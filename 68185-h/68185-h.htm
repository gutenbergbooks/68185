  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>European history has been written in terms of
nationality and of language, but never before in
terms of race; yet race has played a far larger part
than either language or nationality in moulding the
destinies of men; race implies heredity and heredity
implies all the moral, social and intellectual
characteristics and traits which are the springs of
politics and government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite independently and unconsciously the author,
never before a historian, has turned this
historical sketch into the current of a great biological
movement, which may be traced back to
the teachings of Galton and Weismann, beginning
in the last third of the nineteenth century. This
movement has compelled us to recognize the
superior force and stability of heredity, as being
more enduring and potent than environment.
This movement is also a reaction from the teachings
of Hippolyte Taine among historians and of Herbert
Spencer among biologists, because it proves
that environment and in the case of man, education,
have an immediate, apparent and temporary
influence, while heredity has a deep, subtle and
permanent influence on the actions of men.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Thus the racial history of Europe, which forms
the author’s main outline and subject and which
is wholly original in treatment, might be paraphrased
as the heredity history of Europe. It is
history as influenced by the hereditary impulses,
predispositions and tendencies which, as highly
distinctive racial traits, date back many thousands
of years and were originally formed when man was
still in the tribal state, long before the advent of
civilization.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the author’s opening chapters these traits
and tendencies are commented upon as they are
observed to-day under the varying influences of
migration and changes of social and physical environment.
In the chapters relating to the racial
history of Europe we enter a new and fascinating
field of study, which I trust the author himself
may some day expand into a longer story. There
is no gainsaying that this is the correct scientific
method of approaching the problem of the past.</p>

<p class='c007'>The moral tendency of the heredity interpretation
of history is for our day and generation and
is in strong accord with the true spirit of the
modern eugenics movement in relation to patriotism,
namely, the conservation and multiplication
for our country of the best spiritual, moral, intellectual
and physical forces of heredity; thus only
will the integrity of our institutions be maintained
in the future. These divine forces are more or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>less sporadically distributed in all races, some of
them are found in what we call the lowest races,
some are scattered widely throughout humanity,
but they are certainly more widely and uniformly
distributed in some races than in others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus conservation of that race which has given
us the true spirit of Americanism is not a matter
either of racial pride or of racial prejudice; it is a
matter of love of country, of a true sentiment
which is based upon knowledge and the lessons of
history rather than upon the sentimentalism which
is fostered by ignorance. If I were asked: What
is the greatest danger which threatens the American
republic to-day? I would certainly reply: The gradual
dying out among our people of those hereditary
traits through which the principles of our religious,
political and social foundations were laid down and
their insidious replacement by traits of less noble
character.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>History is repeating itself in America at the
present time and incidentally is giving a convincing
demonstration of the central thought in this
volume, namely, that heredity and racial predisposition
are stronger and more stable than environment
and education.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever may be its intellectual, its literary,
its artistic or its musical aptitudes, as compared
with other races, the Anglo-Saxon branch of the
Nordic race is again showing itself to be that upon
which the nation must chiefly depend for leadership,
for courage, for loyalty, for unity and harmony
of action, for self-sacrifice and devotion to
an ideal. Not that members of other races are
not doing their part, many of them are, but in no
other human stock which has come to this country
is there displayed the unanimity of heart, mind
and action which is now being displayed by the
descendants of the blue eyed, fair-haired peoples
of the north of Europe. In a recent journey in
northern California and Oregon I noted that, in
the faces of the regiments which were first to leave
for the city of New York and later that, in the
wonderful array of young men at Plattsburg, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>Anglo-Saxon type was clearly dominant over every
other and the purest members of this type largely
outnumbered the others. In northern California I
saw a great regiment detrain and with one or two
exceptions they were all native Americans, descendants
of the English, Scotch and north of
Ireland men who founded the State of Oregon
in the first half of the nineteenth century. At
Plattsburg fair hair and blue eyes were very noticeable,
much more so than in any ordinary crowds
of American collegians as seen assembled in our
universities.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be remembered also that many of the
dark-haired, dark-eyed youths of Plattsburg and
other volunteer training camps are often three-fourths
or seven-eighths Nordic, because it only requires
a single dark-eyed ancestor to lend the dark
hair and eye color to an otherwise pure Nordic
strain. There is a clear differentiation between the
original Nordic, the Alpine and the Mediterranean
strains; but where physical characters and characteristics
are partly combined in a mosaic, and to
a less degree are blended, it requires long experience
to judge which strain dominates.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a race having these predispositions, extending
back to the very beginnings of European
history, there is no hesitation or even waiting for
conscription and the sad thought was continually
in my mind in California, in Oregon and in Plattsburg
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>that again this race was passing, that this
war will take a very heavy toll of this strain of
Anglo-Saxon life which has played so large a part
in American history.</p>

<p class='c007'>War is in the highest sense dysgenic rather than
eugenic. It is destructive of the best strains, spiritually,
morally and physically. For the world’s
future the destruction of wealth is a small matter
compared with the destruction of the best human
strains, for wealth can be renewed while these strains
of the real human aristocracy once lost are lost
forever. In the new world that we are working
and fighting for, the world of liberty, of justice and
of humanity, we shall save democracy only when
democracy discovers its own aristocracy as in the
days when our Republic was founded.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The following pages are devoted to an attempt
to elucidate the meaning of history in terms of
race; that is, by the physical and psychical characters
of the inhabitants of Europe instead of by
their political grouping or by their spoken language.
Practically all historians, while using the
word race, have relied on tribal or national names
as its sole definition. The ancients, like the moderns,
in determining ethnical origin did not look
beyond a man’s name, language or country and
the actual information furnished by classic literature
on the subject of physical characters is
limited to a few scattered and often obscure
remarks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern anthropology has demonstrated that
racial lines are not only absolutely independent of
both national and linguistic groupings, but that in
many cases these racial lines cut through them at
sharp angles and correspond closely with the divisions
of social cleavage. The great lesson of the
science of race is the immutability of somatological
or bodily characters, with which is closely associated
the immutability of psychical predispositions
and impulses. This continuity of inheritance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>has a most important bearing on the theory
of democracy and still more upon that of socialism,
for it naturally tends to reduce the relative importance
of environment. Those engaged in social
uplift and in revolutionary movements are therefore
usually very intolerant of the limitations
imposed by heredity. Discussion of these limitations
is also most offensive to the advocates of
the obliteration, under the guise of internationalism,
of all existing distinctions based on nationality,
language, race, religion and class. Those individuals
who have neither country, nor flag, nor
language, nor class, nor even surnames of their
own and who can only acquire them by gift or
assumption, very naturally decry and sneer at the
value of these attributes of the higher types.</p>

<p class='c007'>Democratic theories of government in their modern
form are based on dogmas of equality formulated
some hundred and fifty years ago and rest
upon the assumption that environment and not
heredity is the controlling factor in human development.
Philanthropy and noble purpose dictated
the doctrine expressed in the Declaration of Independence,
the document which to-day constitutes
the actual basis of American institutions. The men
who wrote the words, “we hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men are created equal,” were
themselves the owners of slaves and despised
Indians as something less than human. Equality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>in their minds meant merely that they were just
as good Englishmen as their brothers across the
sea. The words “that all men are created equal”
have since been subtly falsified by adding the
word “free,” although no such expression is found
in the original document and the teachings based
on these altered words in the American public
schools of to-day would startle and amaze the men
who formulated the Declaration.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be necessary for the reader to divest his
mind of all preconceptions as to race, since modern
anthropology, when applied to history, involves
an entire change of definition. We must, first of
all, realize that race pure and simple, the physical
and psychical structure of man, is something entirely
distinct from either nationality or language.
Furthermore, race lies at the base of all the manifestation
of modern society, just as it has done
throughout the unrecorded eons of the past and
the laws of nature operate with the same relentless
and unchanging force in human affairs as in the
phenomena of inanimate nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The antiquity of existing European populations,
viewed in the light thrown upon their origins by
the discoveries of the last few decades, enables us
to carry back history and prehistory into periods
so remote that the classic world is but of yesterday.
The living peoples of Europe consist of layer
upon layer of diverse racial elements in varying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>proportions and historians and anthropologists,
while studying these populations, have been concerned
chiefly with the recent strata and have
neglected the more ancient and submerged types.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aboriginal populations from time immemorial
have been again and again swamped under floods
of newcomers and have disappeared for a time
from historic view. In the course of centuries,
however, these primitive elements have slowly reasserted
their physical type and have gradually bred
out their conquerors, so that the racial history of
Europe has been in the past, and is to-day, a story
of the repression and resurgence of ancient races.</p>

<p class='c007'>Invasions of new races have ordinarily arrived in
successive waves, the earlier ones being quickly
absorbed by the conquered, while the later arrivals
usually maintain longer the purity of their type.
Consequently the more recent elements are found
in a less mixed state than the older and the more
primitive strata of the population always contain
physical traits derived from still more ancient predecessors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man has inhabited Europe in some form or
other for hundreds of thousands of years and
during all this lapse of time the population has
been as dense as the food supply permitted. Tribes
in the hunting stage are necessarily of small size,
no matter how abundant the game and in the
Paleolithic period man probably existed only in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>specially favorable localities and in relatively
small communities.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Neolithic and Bronze periods domesticated
animals and the knowledge of agriculture,
although of primitive character, afforded an enlarged
food supply and the population in consequence
greatly increased. The lake dwellers of
the Neolithic were, for example, relatively numerous.
With the clearing of the forests and the
draining of the swamps during the Middle Ages
and, above all, with the industrial expansion of
the last century the population multiplied with
great rapidity. We can, of course, form little or
no estimate of the numbers of the Paleolithic
population of Europe and not much more of those
of Neolithic times, but even the latter must have
been very small in comparison with the census of
to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some conception of the growth of population in
recent times may be based on the increase in England.
It has been computed that Saxon England
at the time of the Conquest contained about
1,500,000 inhabitants, at the time of Queen Elizabeth
the population was about 4,000,000, while
in 1911 the census gave for the same area some
35,000,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immense range of the subject of race in connection
with history from its nebulous dawn and
the limitations of space, require that generalizations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>must often be stated without mention of
exceptions. These sweeping statements may even
appear to be too bold, but they rest, to the best of
the writer’s belief, upon solid foundations of facts
or else are legitimate conclusions from evidence
now in hand. In a science as recent as modern
anthropology, new facts are constantly revealed
and require the modification of existing hypotheses.
The more the subject is studied, the more provisional
even the best-sustained theory appears,
but modern research opens a vista of vast interest
and significance to man, now that we have discarded
the shackles of former false viewpoints and
are able to discern, even though dimly, the solution
of many of the problems of race. In the future
new data will inevitably expand and perhaps
change our ideas, but such facts as are now in
hand and the conclusions based thereupon are
provisionally set forth in the following chapters
and necessarily often in a dogmatic form.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statements relating to time have presented
the greatest difficulty, as the authorities differ
widely, but the dates have been fixed with extreme
conservatism and the writer believes that
whatever changes in them are hereafter required
by further investigation and study, will result in
pushing them back and not forward in prehistory.
The dates given in the chapter on “Paleolithic
Man” are frankly taken from the most recent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>authority on this subject, “The Men of the Old
Stone Age,” by Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn and
the writer desires to take this opportunity to
acknowledge his great indebtedness to this source
of information, as well as to Mr. M. Taylor Pyne
and to Mr. Charles Stewart Davison for their assistance
and many helpful suggestions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author also wishes to acknowledge his
obligation to Prof. William Z. Ripley’s “The
Races of Europe,” which contains a large array of
anthropological measurements, maps and type
portraits, providing valuable data for the present
distribution of the three primary races of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The American Geographical Society and its
staff, particularly Mr. Leon Dominian, have also
been of great help in the preparation of the maps
herein contained and this occasion is taken by the
writer to express his appreciation for their assistance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH REVISED EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The addition of a Documentary Supplement to
the latest revision of this book has been made in response
to a persistent demand for “authorities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has endeavored to make the references
and quotations in this Supplement very full and,
so far as possible, interesting in themselves as well
as entirely distinct from the text, which stands
substantially unchanged, and the authorities quoted
are not necessarily the sources of the views herein
expressed but more often are given in support of
them. The contents of the book, since its first
appearance, have had the advantage of the criticism
of virtually every anthropologist in America and in
England, France and Italy—many of whom have
furnished the author with valuable corroborative
material. Some of this material appears in the
notes, but accessible authorities and the classical
writers have been given the more prominent place.
The supplement covered, as first prepared, substantially
every statement in the book, but much was
afterward omitted because it would seem that some
things could be taken without proof.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>“The Passing of the Great Race,” in its original
form, was designed by the author to rouse his fellow-Americans
to the overwhelming importance of race
and to the folly of the “Melting Pot” theory, even
at the expense of bitter controversy. This purpose
has been accomplished thoroughly, and one of the
most far-reaching effects of the doctrines enunciated
in this volume and in the discussions that followed
its publication was the decision of the Congress of
the United States to adopt discriminatory and restrictive
measures against the immigration of undesirable
races and peoples.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of the results has been the publication in
America and Europe of a series of books and articles
more or less anthropological in character
which have sustained or controverted its main
theme. The new definition of race and the controlling
rôle played by race in all the manifestations of
what we call civilization are now generally accepted
even by those whose political position depends upon
popular favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was to be expected that there would be bitter
opposition to those definitions of race which are
based on physical and psychical characters that are
immutable, rather than upon those derived from
language or political allegiance, that are easily
altered.</p>

<p class='c007'>To admit the unchangeable differentiation of race
in its modern scientific meaning is to admit inevitably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>the existence of superiority in one race and of
inferiority in another. Such an admission we can
hardly expect from those of inferior races. These
inferior races and classes are prompt to recognize
in such an admission the very real danger to
themselves of being relegated again to their former
obscurity and subordinate position in society. The
favorite defense of these inferior classes is an unqualified
denial of the existence of fixed inherited
qualities, either physical or spiritual, which cannot
be obliterated or greatly modified by a change
of environment. Failing in this, as they must
necessarily fail, they point out the presence of
mixed or intermediate types, and claim that in
these mixtures, or blends as they choose to call them,
the higher type tends to predominate. In fact, of
course, the exact opposite is the case and it is
scarcely necessary to cite the universal distrust,
often contempt, that the half-breed between two
sharply contrasted races inspires the world over.
Belonging physically and spiritually to the lower
race, but aspiring to recognition as one of the higher
race, the unfortunate mongrel, in addition to a disharmonic
physique, often inherits from one parent
an unstable brain which is stimulated and at times
overexcited by flashes of brilliancy from the other.
The result is a total lack of continuity of purpose,
an intermittent intellect goaded into spasmodic outbursts
of energy. Physical and psychical disharmonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>are common among crosses between Indians,
negroes and whites, but where the parents are more
closely related racially we often obtain individuals occupying
the border-land between genius and insanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The essential character of all these racial mixtures
is a lack of harmony—both physical and mental—in
the first few generations. Then, if the strain survives,
it is by the slow reversion to one of the parent
types—almost inevitably the lower.</p>

<p class='c007'>The temporary advantage of mere numbers enjoyed
by the inferior classes in modern democracies
can only be made permanent by the destruction of
superior types—by massacre, as in Russia, or by taxation,
as in England. In the latter country the financial
burdens of the war and the selfish interests of
labor have imposed such a load of taxation upon
the upper and middle classes that marriage and children
are becoming increasingly burdensome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best example of complete elimination of a
dominant class is in Santo Domingo. The horrors
of the black revolt were followed by the slow death
of the culture of the white man. This history should
be studied carefully because it gives in prophetic
form the sequence of events that we may expect to
find in Mexico and in parts of South America where
the replacement of the higher type by the resurgent
native is taking place.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the countries inhabited by a population more
or less racially uniform the phenomenon of the multiplication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>of the inferior classes fostered and aided
by the noble but fatuous philanthropy of the well-to-do
everywhere appears. Nature’s laws when
unchecked maintain a relatively fixed ratio between
the classes, which is greatly impaired in modern
society by humanitarian and charitable activities.
The resurgence of inferior races and classes throughout
not merely Europe but the world, is evident in
every despatch from Egypt, Ireland, Poland, Rumania,
India and Mexico. It is called nationalism,
patriotism, freedom and other high-sounding names,
but it is everywhere the phenomenon of the long-suppressed,
conquered servile classes rising against
the master race. The late Peloponnesian War in the
world at large, like the Civil War in America, has
shattered the prestige of the white race and it will
take several generations and perhaps wars to recover
its former control, if it ever does regain it.
The danger is from within and not from without.
Neither the black, nor the brown, nor the yellow, nor
the red will conquer the white in battle. But if the
valuable elements in the Nordic race mix with inferior
strains or die out through race suicide, then
the citadel of civilization will fall for mere lack of
defenders.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the curious effects of democracy is the
unquestionable fact that there is less freedom of the
press than under autocratic forms of government.
It is well-nigh impossible to publish in the American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>newspapers any reflection upon certain religions
or races which are hysterically sensitive even when
mentioned by name. The underlying idea seems
to be that if publication can be suppressed the facts
themselves will ultimately disappear. Abroad, conditions
are fully as bad, and we have the authority
of one of the most eminent anthropologists in France
that the collection of anthropological measurements
and data among French recruits at the outbreak of
the Great War was prevented by Jewish influence,
which aimed to suppress any suggestion of racial
differentiation in France. In the United States also,
during the war, we were unable to obtain complete
measurements and data, in spite of the self-devotion
of certain scientists, like Drs. Davenport, Sullivan
and others. This failure was due to lack of time
and equipment and not to racial influences, but in
the near future we may confidently expect in this
country strenuous opposition to any public discussion
of race as such.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rapidly growing appreciation of the importance
of race during the last few years, the study of
the influence of race on nationality as shown by the
after-war disputes over boundaries, the increasing
complexity of our own problems between the whites
and blacks, between the Americans and Japs, and
between the native Americans and the hyphenated
aliens in our midst upon whom we have carelessly
urged citizenship, and, above all, the recognition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>that the leaders of labor and their more zealous followers
are almost all foreigners, have served to arouse
Americans to a realization of the menace of the impending
Migration of Peoples through unrestrained
freedom of entry here. The days of the Civil War
and the provincial sentimentalism which governed or
misgoverned our public opinion are past, and this
generation must completely repudiate the proud
boast of our fathers that they acknowledged no
distinction in “race, creed, or color,” or else the native
American must turn the page of history and
write:</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Failure to recognize the clear distinction between
race and nationality and the still greater
distinction between race and language and the easy
assumption that the one is indicative of the other
have been in the past serious impediments to an
understanding of racial values. Historians and
philologists have approached the subject from the
viewpoint of linguistics and as a result we are
to-day burdened with a group of mythical races,
such as the Latin, the Aryan, the Indo-Germanic,
the Caucasian and, perhaps, most inconsistent of
all, the Celtic race.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man is an animal differing from his fellow inhabitants
of the globe not in kind but only in
degree of development and an intelligent study of
the human species must be preceded by an extended
knowledge of other mammals, especially the primates.
Instead of such essential training, anthropologists
often seek to qualify by research
in linguistics, religion or marriage customs or in
designs of pottery or blanket weaving, all of which
relate to ethnology alone. As a result the influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of environment is often overestimated and overstated
at the expense of heredity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of race has been further complicated
by the effort of old-fashioned theologians
to cramp all mankind into the scant six thousand
years of Hebrew chronology as expounded by Archbishop
Ussher. Religious teachers have also maintained
the proposition not only that man is something
fundamentally distinct from other living
creatures, but that there are no inherited differences
in humanity that cannot be obliterated
by education and environment.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, therefore, necessary at the outset for the
reader to appreciate thoroughly that race, language
and nationality are three separate and
distinct things and that in Europe these three
elements are found only occasionally persisting
in combination, as in the Scandinavian nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>To realize the transitory nature of political
boundaries one has but to consider the changes
which have occurred during the past century
and as to language, here in America we hear daily
the English language spoken by many men who
possess not one drop of English blood and who, a
few years since, knew not one word of Saxon speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of certain religious and social
doctrines, now happily becoming obsolete, race
consciousness has been greatly impaired among
civilized nations but in the beginning all differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of class, of caste and of color marked actual
lines of race cleavage.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many countries the existing classes represent
races that were once distinct. In the city
of New York and elsewhere in the United States
there is a native American aristocracy resting upon
layer after layer of immigrants of lower races
and these native Americans, while, of course, disclaiming
the distinction of a patrician class and
lacking in class consciousness and class dignity,
have, nevertheless, up to this time supplied the
leaders in thought and in the control of capital as
well as of education and of the religious ideals and
altruistic bias of the community.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the democratic forms of government the
operation of universal suffrage tends toward the
selection of the average man for public office rather
than the man qualified by birth, education and
integrity. How this scheme of administration
will ultimately work out remains to be seen but
from a racial point of view it will inevitably increase
the preponderance of the lower types and
cause a corresponding loss of efficiency in the
community as a whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tendency in a democracy is toward a standardization
of type and a diminution of the influence
of genius. A majority must of necessity
be inferior to a picked minority and it always
resents specializations in which it cannot share.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>In the French Revolution the majority, calling
itself “the people,” deliberately endeavored to
destroy the higher type and something of the
same sort was in a measure done after the American
Revolution by the expulsion of the Loyalists
and the confiscation of their lands, with a resultant
loss to the growing nation of good race strains,
which were in the next century replaced by immigrants
of far lower type.</p>

<p class='c007'>In America we have nearly succeeded in destroying
the privilege of birth; that is, the intellectual
and moral advantage a man of good stock
brings into the world with him. We are now engaged
in destroying the privilege of wealth; that
is, the reward of successful intelligence and industry
and in some quarters there is developing
a tendency to attack the privilege of intellect
and to deprive a man of the advantage gained from
an early and thorough classical education. Simplified
spelling is a step in this direction. Ignorance
of English grammar or classic learning must not,
forsooth, be held up as a reproach to the political
or social aspirant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mankind emerged from savagery and barbarism
under the leadership of selected individuals
whose personal prowess, capacity or wisdom gave
them the right to lead and the power to compel
obedience. Such leaders have always been a minute
fraction of the whole, but as long as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>tradition of their predominance persisted they were
able to use the brute strength of the unthinking
herd as part of their own force and were able to
direct at will the blind dynamic impulse of the
slaves, peasants or lower classes. Such a despot
had an enormous power at his disposal which, if
he were benevolent or even intelligent, could be
used and most frequently was used for the general
uplift of the race. Even those rulers who most
abused this power put down with merciless rigor
the antisocial elements, such as pirates, brigands
or anarchists, which impair the progress of a community,
as disease or wounds cripple an individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>True aristocracy or a true republic is government
by the wisest and best, always a small minority
in any population. Human society is like
a serpent dragging its long body on the ground,
but with the head always thrust a little in advance
and a little elevated above the earth. The serpent’s
tail, in human society represented by the
antisocial forces, was in the past dragged by
sheer strength along the path of progress. Such has
been the organization of mankind from the beginning,
and such it still is in older communities than
ours. What progress humanity can make under
the control of universal suffrage, or the rule of the
average, may find a further analogy in the habits of
certain snakes which wiggle sideways and disregard
the head with its brains and eyes. Such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>serpents, however, are not noted for their ability
to make rapid progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>A true republic, the function of which is administration
in the interests of the whole community—in
contrast to a pure democracy, which in
last analysis is the rule of the demos or a majority
in its own interests—should be, and often is, the
medium of selection for the technical task of
government of those best qualified by antecedents,
character and education, in short, of experts.</p>

<p class='c007'>To use another simile, in an aristocratic as
distinguished from a plutocratic or democratic
organization the intellectual and talented classes
form the point of the lance while the massive
shaft represents the body of the population and
adds by its bulk and weight to the penetrative
impact of the tip. In a democratic system this
concentrated force is dispersed throughout the
mass. It supplies, to be sure, a certain amount
of leaven but in the long run the force and genius
of the small minority is dissipated, and its efficiency
lost. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox populi</span></i>, so far from being <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox
Dei</span></i>, thus becomes an unending wail for rights and
never a chant of duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where a conquering race is imposed on another
race the institution of slavery often arises to compel
the servient race to work and to introduce
it forcibly to a higher form of civilization. As
soon as men can be induced to labor to supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>their own needs slavery becomes wasteful and
tends to vanish. From a material point of view
slaves are often more fortunate than freemen when
treated with reasonable humanity and when their
elemental wants of food, clothing and shelter are
supplied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians around the fur posts in northern
Canada were formerly the virtual bond slaves of
the Hudson Bay Company, each Indian and his
squaw and pappoose being adequately supplied
with simple food and equipment. He was protected
as well against the white man’s rum as the
red man’s scalping parties and in return gave the
Company all his peltries—the whole product of his
year’s work. From an Indian’s point of view this
was nearly an ideal condition but was to all intents
serfdom or slavery. When through the opening
up of the country the continuance of such an
archaic system became an impossibility, the Indian
sold his furs to the highest bidder, received a large
price in cash and then wasted the proceeds in
trinkets instead of blankets and in rum instead of
flour, with the result that he is now gloriously free
but is on the highroad to becoming a diseased outcast.
In this case of the Hudson Bay Indian the
advantages of the upward step from serfdom to
freedom are not altogether clear. A very similar
condition of vassalage existed until recently among
the peons of Mexico, but without the compensation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the control of an intelligent and provident
ruling class.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same way serfdom in mediæval Europe
apparently was a device through which the landowners
repressed the nomadic instinct in their
tenantry which became marked when the fertility
of the land declined after the dissolution of the
Roman Empire. Years are required to bring land
to its highest productivity and agriculture cannot
be successfully practised even in well-watered and
fertile districts by farmers who continually drift
from one locality to another. The serf or villein
was, therefore, tied by law to the land and could
not leave except with his master’s consent. As
soon as the nomadic instinct was eliminated
serfdom vanished. One has but to read the
severe laws against vagrancy in England just
before the Reformation to realize how widespread
and serious was this nomadic instinct.
Here in America we have not yet forgotten the
wandering instincts of our Western pioneers, which
in that case proved beneficial to every one except
the migrants.</p>

<p class='c007'>While democracy is fatal to progress when two
races of unequal value live side by side, an aristocracy
may be equally injurious whenever, in
order to purchase a few generations of ease and
luxury, slaves or immigrants are imported to do the
heavy work. It was a form of aristocracy that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>brought slaves to the American colonies and the
West Indies and if there had been an aristocratic
form of governmental control in California, Chinese
coolies and Japanese laborers would now form the
controlling element, so far as numbers are concerned,
on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the upper classes who encouraged the
introduction of immigrant labor to work American
factories and mines and it is the native American
gentleman who builds a palace on the country side
and who introduces as servants all manner of
foreigners into purely American districts. The
farming and artisan classes of America did not
take alarm until it was too late and they are now
seriously threatened with extermination in many
parts of the country. In Rome, also, it was the plebeian,
who first went under in the competition with
slaves but the patrician followed in his turn a few
generations later.</p>

<p class='c007'>The West Indian sugar planters flourished in the
eighteenth century and produced some strong
men; to-day from the same causes they have vanished
from the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last century the New England manufacturer
imported the Irish and French Canadians
and the resultant fall in the New England birth rate
at once became ominous. The refusal of the
native American to work with his hands when he
can hire or import serfs to do manual labor for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>is the prelude to his extinction and the immigrant
laborers are now breeding out their masters and
killing by filth and by crowding as effectively as by
the sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the American sold his birthright in a continent
to solve a labor problem. Instead of retaining
political control and making citizenship an
honorable and valued privilege, he intrusted the
government of his country and the maintenance of
his ideals to races who have never yet succeeded in
governing themselves, much less any one else.</p>

<p class='c007'>Associated with this advance of democracy and
the transfer of power from the higher to the lower
races, from the intellectual to the plebeian class, we
find the spread of socialism and the recrudescence
of obsolete religious forms. Although these phenomena
appear to be contradictory, they are in reality
closely related since both represent reactions
from the intense individualism which a century
ago was eminently characteristic of Americans.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>II<br /> <span class='large'>THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF RACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the modern and scientific study of race we
have long since discarded the Adamic theory that
man is descended from a single pair, created a few
thousand years ago in a mythical Garden of Eden
somewhere in Asia, to spread later over the earth
in successive waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a fact, however, that Asia was the chief
area of evolution and differentiation of man and
that the various groups had their main development
there and not on the peninsula we call Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the races of Europe, both living and
extinct, did come from the East through Asia
Minor or by way of the African littoral, but most
of the direct ancestors of existing populations
have inhabited Europe for many thousands of
years. During that time numerous races of men
have passed over the scene. Some undoubtedly
have utterly vanished and some have left their
blood behind them in the Europeans of to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now know, since the elaboration of the
Mendelian Laws of Inheritance, that certain bodily
characters, such as skull shape, stature, eye color,
hair color and nose form, some of which are so-called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>unit characters, are transmitted in accordance
with fixed laws, and, further, that various characters
which are normally correlated or linked
together in pure races may, after a prolonged
admixture of races, pass down separately and
form what is known as disharmonic combinations.
Such disharmonic combinations are, for example, a
tall brunet or a short blond; blue eyes associated
with brunet hair or brown eyes with blond hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process of intermixture of characters has
gone far in existing populations and through the
ease of modern methods of transportation this
process is going much further in Europe and in
America. The results of such mixture are not
blends or intermediate types, but rather mosaics
of contrasted characters. Such blends, if any, as
ultimately occur are too remote to concern us here.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crossing of an individual of pure brunet race
with an individual of pure blond race produces in
the first generation offspring which are distinctly
dark. In subsequent generations, brunets and
blonds appear in various proportions but the former
tend to be much the more numerous. The blond is
consequently said to be recessive to the brunet because
it recedes from view in the first generation.
This or any similar recessive or suppressed trait is
not lost to the germ plasm, but reappears in later
generations of the hybridized stock. A similar rule
prevails with other physical characters.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>In defining race in Europe it is necessary not
only to consider pure groups or pure types but
also the distribution of characters belonging to
each particular subspecies of man found there.
The interbreeding of these populations has progressed
to such an extent that in many cases such
an analysis of physical characters is necessary to
reconstruct the elements which have entered into
their ethnic composition. To rely on averages
alone leads to misunderstanding and to disregard
of the relative proportion of pure, as contrasted
with mixed types.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes we find a character appearing here
and there as the sole remnant of a once numerous
race, for example, the rare appearance in
European populations of a skull of the Neanderthal
type, a race widely spread over Europe 40,000
years ago, or of the Cro-Magnon type, the predominant
race 16,000 years ago. Before the fossil
remains of the Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon races
were studied and understood such reversional
specimens were considered pathological, instead
of being recognized as the reappearance of an
ancient and submerged type.</p>

<p class='c007'>These physical characters are to all intents and
purposes immutable and they do not change during
the lifetime of a language or an empire. The
skull shape of the Egyptian fellaheen, in the unchanging
environment of the Nile Valley, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>absolutely identical in measurements, proportions
and capacity with skulls found in the pre-dynastic
tombs dating back more than six thousand
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>There exists to-day a widespread and fatuous
belief in the power of environment, as well as of
education and opportunity to alter heredity, which
arises from the dogma of the brotherhood of man,
derived in its turn from the loose thinkers of the
French Revolution and their American mimics.
Such beliefs have done much damage in the past
and if allowed to go uncontradicted, may do even
more serious damage in the future. Thus the view
that the Negro slave was an unfortunate cousin
of the white man, deeply tanned by the tropic
sun and denied the blessings of Christianity and
civilization, played no small part with the sentimentalists
of the Civil War period and it has
taken us fifty years to learn that speaking English,
wearing good clothes and going to school and to
church do not transform a Negro into a white
man. Nor was a Syrian or Egyptian freedman
transformed into a Roman by wearing a toga and
applauding his favorite gladiator in the amphitheatre.
Americans will have a similar experience
with the Polish Jew, whose dwarf stature, peculiar
mentality and ruthless concentration on self-interest
are being engrafted upon the stock of the
nation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Recent attempts have been made in the interest
of inferior races among our immigrants to
show that the shape of the skull does change, not
merely in a century, but in a single generation.
In 1910, the report of the anthropological expert
of the Congressional Immigration Commission
gravely declared that a round skull Jew on his way
across the Atlantic might and did have a round
skull child; but a few years later, in response to
the subtle elixir of American institutions as exemplified
in an East Side tenement, might and
did have a child whose skull was appreciably
longer; and that a long skull south Italian, breeding
freely, would have precisely the same experience
in the reverse direction. In other words the
Melting Pot was acting instantly under the influence
of a changed environment.</p>

<p class='c007'>What the Melting Pot actually does in practice
can be seen in Mexico, where the absorption
of the blood of the original Spanish conquerors
by the native Indian population has produced
the racial mixture which we call Mexican and
which is now engaged in demonstrating its incapacity
for self-government. The world has seen
many such mixtures and the character of a mongrel
race is only just beginning to be understood
at its true value.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be borne in mind that the specializations
which characterize the higher races are of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>relatively recent development, are highly unstable
and when mixed with generalized or primitive
characters tend to disappear. Whether we like
to admit it or not, the result of the mixture of
two races, in the long run, gives us a race reverting
to the more ancient, generalized and lower
type. The cross between a white man and an Indian
is an Indian; the cross between a white man
and a Negro is a Negro; the cross between a white
man and a Hindu is a Hindu; and the cross between
any of the three European races and a Jew
is a Jew.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the crossing of the blond and brunet elements
of a population, the more deeply rooted
and ancient dark traits are prepotent or dominant.
This is matter of everyday observation and the
working of this law of nature is not influenced or
affected by democratic institutions or by religious
beliefs. Nature cares not for the individual nor
how he may be modified by environment. She
is concerned only with the perpetuation of the species
or type and heredity alone is the medium
through which she acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>As measured in terms of centuries these characters
are fixed and rigid and the only benefit to be
derived from a changed environment and better
food conditions is the opportunity afforded a
race which has lived under adverse conditions
to achieve its maximum development but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>limits of that development are fixed for it by
heredity and not by environment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In dealing with European populations the best
method of determining race has been found to lie
in a comparison of proportions of the skull, the so-called
cephalic index. This is the ratio of maximum
<em>width</em>, taken at the widest part of the skull above
the ears, to maximum <em>length</em>. Skulls with an index
of 75 or less, that is, those with a width that is three-fourths
of the length or less, are considered dolichocephalic
or long skulls. Skulls of an index of
80 or over are round or brachycephalic skulls.
Intermediate indices, between 75 and 80, are considered
mesaticephalic. These are cranial indices.
To allow for the flesh on living specimens about
two per cent is to be added to this index and the
result is the cephalic index. In the following
pages only long and round skulls are considered
and the intermediate forms are assigned to the
dolichocephalic group.</p>

<p class='c007'>This cephalic index, though an extremely important
if not the controlling character, is, nevertheless,
but a single character and must be checked
up with other somatological traits. Normally, a
long skull is associated with a long face and a
round skull with a round face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of this test, the cephalic index, enables
us to divide the great bulk of the European populations
into three distinct subspecies of man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>one northern and one southern, both dolichocephalic
or characterized by a long skull and a
central subspecies which is brachycephalic or characterized
by a round skull.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first is the Nordic or Baltic subspecies. This
race is long skulled, very tall, fair skinned with
blond or brown hair and light colored eyes. The
Nordics inhabit the countries around the North
and Baltic Seas and include not only the great
Scandinavian and Teutonic groups, but also other
early peoples who first appear in southern Europe
and in Asia as representatives of Aryan language
and culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second is the dark Mediterranean or Iberian
subspecies, occupying the shores of the inland sea
and extending along the Atlantic coast until it
reaches the Nordic species. It also spreads far
east into southern Asia. It is long skulled like
the Nordic race but the absolute size of the skull
is less. The eyes and hair are very dark or black
and the skin more or less swarthy. The stature is
distinctly less than that of the Nordic race and the
musculature and bony framework weak.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third is the Alpine subspecies occupying
all central and eastern Europe and extending
through Asia Minor to the Hindu Kush and the
Pamirs. The Armenoids constitute an Alpine subdivision
and may possibly represent the ancestral
type of this race which remained in the mountains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and high plateaux of Anatolia and western
Asia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpines are round skulled, of medium
height and sturdy build both as to skeleton and
muscles. The coloration of both hair and eyes was
originally very dark and still tends strongly in that
direction but many light colored eyes, especially
gray, are now common among the Alpine populations
of western Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the inhabitants of Europe betray as a
whole their mixed origin, nevertheless, individuals
of each of the three main subspecies are found in
large numbers and in great purity, as well as sparse
remnants of still more ancient races represented
by small groups or by individuals and even by
single characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>These three main groups have bodily characters
which constitute them distinct subspecies. Each
group is a large one and includes several well-marked
varieties, which differ even more widely
in cultural development than in physical divergence
so that when the Mediterranean of England
is compared with the Hindu, or the Alpine Savoyard
with the Rumanian or Turcoman, a wide gulf
is found.</p>

<p class='c007'>In zoology, related species when grouped together
constitute subgenera and genera and the
term species implies the existence of a certain
definite amount of divergence from the most closely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>related type but race does not require a similar
amount of difference. In man, where all groups
are more or less fertile when crossed, so many
intermediate or mixed types occur that the word
species has at the present day too extended a
meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the sake of clearness the word race and
not the word species or subspecies will be used in
the following chapters as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old idea that fertility or infertility of races
of animals was the measure of species is now
abandoned. One of the greatest difficulties in
classifying man is his perverse predisposition to
mismate. This is a matter of daily observation,
especially among the women of the better classes,
probably because of their wider range of choice.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must have existed many subspecies and
species, if not genera, of men since the Pliocene and
new discoveries of their remains may be expected
at any time and in any part of the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cephalic index is of less value in the classification
of Asiatic populations but the distribution
of round and long skulls is similar to that in
Europe. The vast central plateau of that continent
is inhabited by round skulls. In fact, Thibet
and the western Himalayas were probably the
centre of radiation of all the round skulls of the
world. In India and Persia south of this central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>area occurs a long skull race related to Mediterranean
man in Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both skull types occur much intermixed among
the American Indians and the cephalic index is
of little value in classifying the Amerinds. No
satisfactory explanation of the variability of the
skull shape in the western hemisphere has as yet
been found, but the total range of variation of
physical characters among them, from northern
Canada to southern Patagonia, is less than the
range of such variation from Normandy to Provence
in France.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Africa the cephalic index is also of small
classification value because all of the populations
are characterized by a long skull.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction between a long skull and a
round skull in mankind probably goes back at
least to early Paleolithic times, if not to a period
still more remote. It is of such great antiquity
that when new species or races appear in Europe
at the close of the Paleolithic, between 10,000 and
7,000 years B. C., the skull characters among
them are as clearly defined as they are to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that two distinct species of mankind
have long skulls, as have the north European and
the African Negro, is no necessary indication of
relationship and in that instance is merely a case
of parallel specialization, but the fact, however, that
the Swede has a long skull and the Savoyard a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>round skull does prove them to be racially distinct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The claim that the Nordic race is a mere variation
of the Mediterranean race and that the latter
is in turn derived from the Ethiopian Negro
rests upon a mistaken idea that a dolichocephaly in
common must mean identity of origin, as well as
upon a failure to take into consideration many somatological
characters of almost equal value with
the cephalic index. Indeed, the cephalic index,
being merely a ratio, may be identical for skulls
differing in every other proportion and detail, as
well as in absolute size and capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eye color is of very great importance in race
determination because all blue, gray or green
eyes in the world to-day came originally from the
same source, namely, the Nordic race of northern
Europe. This light colored eye has appeared nowhere
else on earth, is a specialization of this
subspecies of man only and consequently is
of extreme value in the classification of European
races. Dark colored eyes are all but universal
among wild mammals and entirely so among the
primates, man’s nearest relatives. It may be
taken as an absolute certainty that all the original
races of man had dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>One subspecies of man and one alone specialized
in light colored eyes. This same subspecies also
evolved light brown or blond hair, a character far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>less deeply rooted than eye color, as blond children
tend to grow darker with advancing years and
populations partly of Nordic extraction, such as
those of Lombardy, upon admixture with darker
races lose their blond hair more readily than their
light colored eyes. In short, light colored eyes
are far more common than light colored hair. In
crosses between Alpines and Nordics, the Alpine
stature and the Nordic eye appear to prevail.
Light color in eyes is largely due to a greater or
less absence of pigment but it is not associated
with weak eyesight, as in the case of Albinos. In
fact, among marksmen, it has been noted that
nearly all the great rifle-shots in England or America
have had light colored eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blond hair also comes everywhere from the
Nordic subspecies and from nowhere else. Whenever
we find blondness among the darker races of
the earth we may be sure some Nordic wanderer has
passed that way. When individuals of perfect
blond type occur, as sometimes in Greek islands,
we may suspect a recent visit of sailors from a
passing ship but when only single characters remain
spread thinly, but widely, over considerable
areas, like the blondness of the Atlas Berbers or
of the Albanian mountaineers, we must search in
the dim past for the origin of these blurred traits
of early invaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The range of blond hair color in pure Nordic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>peoples runs from flaxen and red to shades of chestnut
and brown. The darker shades may indicate
crossing in some cases, but absolutely black hair
certainly does mean an ancestral cross with a
dark race—in England with the Mediterranean
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be clearly understood that blondness of
hair and of eye is not a final test of Nordic race.
The Nordics include all the blonds, and also those
of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance
of other Nordic characters. In this sense the
word “blond” means those lighter shades of hair
or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black
shades which are termed brunet. The meaning
of “blond” as now used is therefore not limited
to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial
speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England among Nordic populations there are
large numbers of individuals with hazel brown
eyes joined with the light brown or chestnut hair
which is the typical hair shade of the English and
Americans. This combination is also common in
Holland and Westphalia and is frequently associated
with a very fair skin. These men are all of “blond”
aspect and constitution and consequently are to
be classed as members of the Nordic race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Nordic populations the women are, in general,
lighter haired than the men, a fact which
points to a blond past and a darker future for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>those populations. Women in all human races,
as the females among all mammals, tend to exhibit
the older, more generalized and primitive traits of
the past of the race. The male in his individual
development indicates the direction in which the
race is tending under the influence of variation and
selection.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to note in connection with the
more primitive physique of the female, that in
the spiritual sphere also women retain the ancient
and intuitive knowledge that the great mass
of mankind is not free and equal but bond and
unequal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The color of the skin is a character of importance
but one that is exceedingly hard to measure
as the range of variation in Europe between
skins of extreme fairness and those that are
exceedingly swarthy is almost complete. The
Nordic race in its purity has an absolutely fair
skin and is consequently the white man par
excellence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many members of the Nordic race otherwise
apparently pure have skins, as well as hair, more
or less dark, so that the determinative value of
this character is uncertain. There can be no
doubt that the quality of the skin and the extreme
range of its variation in color from black,
brown, red, yellow to ivory-white are excellent
measures of the specific or subgeneric distinctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>between the larger groups of mankind but in dealing
with European populations it is sometimes
difficult to correlate the shades of fairness with other
physical characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, hair color and skin color are linked
together, but it often happens that an individual
with all other Nordic characters in great purity
has a skin of an olive or dark tint. Even more
frequently we find individuals with absolutely pure
brunet traits in possession of a skin of almost ivory
whiteness and of great clarity. This last combination
is very frequent among the brunets of the
British Isles. That these are, to some extent, disharmonic
combinations we may be certain but beyond
that our knowledge does not lead. Women,
however, of fair skin have always been the objects
of keen envy by those of the sex whose skins are
black, yellow or red.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stature is another character of greater value
than skin color and, perhaps, than hair color and
is one of much importance in European classification
for on that continent we have the most
extreme variations of human height.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exceedingly adverse economic conditions may
inhibit a race from attaining the full measure of
its growth and to this extent environment plays its
part in determining stature but fundamentally it
is race, always race, that sets the limit. The tall
Scot and the dwarfed Sardinian owe their respective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>sizes to race and not to oatmeal or olive oil.
It is probable, however, that the fact that the stature
of the Irish is, on the average, shorter than
that of the Scotch is due partly to economic conditions
and partly to the depressive effect of a
considerable population of primitive short stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mediterranean race is everywhere marked
by a relatively short stature, sometimes greatly
depressed, as in south Italy and in Sardinia, and
also by a comparatively light bony framework and
feeble muscular development.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpine race is taller than the Mediterranean,
although shorter than the Nordic, and is characterized
by a stocky and sturdy build. The Alpines
rarely, if ever, show the long necks and graceful
figures so often found in the other two races.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordic race is nearly everywhere distinguished
by great stature. Almost the tallest stature
in the world is found among the pure Nordic populations
of the Scottish and English borders while
the native British of Pre-Nordic brunet blood
are for the most part relatively short. No one
can question the race value of stature who observes
on the streets of London the contrast
between the Piccadilly gentleman of Nordic race
and the cockney costermonger of the old Neolithic
type.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases where these three European races
have become mixed stature seems to be one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the first Nordic characters to vanish, but wherever
in Europe we find great stature in a population
otherwise lacking in Nordic characters we may
suspect a Nordic crossing, as in the case of a
large proportion of the inhabitants of Burgundy,
of the Tyrol and of the Dalmatian Alps south to
Albania.</p>

<p class='c007'>These four characters, skull shape, eye color,
hair color and stature, are sufficient to enable
us to differentiate clearly between the three main
subspecies of Europe, but if we wish to discuss the
minor variations in each race and mixtures between
them, we must go much further and take up other
proportions of the skull than the cephalic index, as
well as the shape and position of the eyes, the
proportions and shape of the jaws, the chin and
other features.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nose is an exceedingly important character.
The original human nose was, of course, broad
and bridgeless. This trait is shown clearly in
new-born infants who recapitulate in their development
the various stages of the evolution of the
human genus. A bridgeless nose with wide, flaring
nostrils is a very primitive character and is still
retained by some of the larger divisions of mankind
throughout the world. It appears occasionally
in white populations of European origin but is
everywhere a very ancient, generalized and low
character.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The high bridge and long, narrow nose, the so-called
Roman, Norman or aquiline nose, is characteristic
of the most highly specialized races of
mankind. While an apparently unimportant character,
this feature is one of the very best clews to
racial origin and in the details of its form, and especially
in the lateral shape of the nostrils, is a
race determinant of the greatest value.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lips, whether thin or fleshy or whether clean-cut
or everted, are race characters. Thick, protruding,
everted lips are very ancient traits and
are characteristic of many primitive races. A high
instep also has long been esteemed an indication of
patrician type while the flat foot is often the test
of lowly origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The absence or abundance of hair and beard
and the relative absence or abundance of body
hair are characters of no little value in classification.
Abundant body hair is, to a large extent,
peculiar to populations of the very highest as
well as the very lowest species, being characteristic
of the north European as well as of the Australian
savages. It merely means the retention in both
these groups of a very early and primitive trait
which has been lost by the Negroes, Mongols and
Amerinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordic and Alpine races are far better
equipped with head and body hair than the Mediterranean,
which is throughout its range a glabrous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>or relatively naked race but among the Nordics
the extreme blond types are less equipped with
body hair or down than are darker members of
the race. A contrast in color between head hair
and beard, the latter always being lighter than
the former, may be one of the results of an ancient
crossing of races.</p>

<p class='c007'>The so-called red-haired branch of the Nordic
race has special characters in addition to red
hair, such as a greenish cast of eye, a skin of delicate
texture tending either to great clarity or to
freckles and certain peculiar temperamental traits.
This was probably a variety closely related to the
blonds and it first appears in history in association
with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the three main European races are the
subject of this book and while it is not the intention
of the author to deal with the other human
types, it is desirable in connection with the discussion
of this character, hair, to state that the
three European subspecies are subdivisions of one
of the primary groups or species of the genus
<em>Homo</em> which, taken together, we may call the
Caucasian for lack of a better name.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existing classification of man must be
radically revised, as the differences between the
most divergent human types are far greater than
are usually deemed sufficient to constitute separate
species and even subgenera in the animal kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>at large. Outside of the three European subspecies
the greater portion of the genus <em>Homo</em> can
be roughly divided into the Negroes and Negroids,
and the Mongols and Mongoloids.</p>

<p class='c007'>The former apparently originated in south Asia
and entered Africa by way of the northeastern corner
of that continent. Africa south of the Sahara is
now the chief home of this race, though remnants
of Negroid aborigines are found throughout south
Asia from India to the Philippines, while the very
distinct black Melanesians and the Australoids
lie farther to the east and south.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mongoloids include the round skulled Mongols
and their derivatives, the Amerinds or American
Indians. This group is essentially Asiatic
and occupies the centre and the eastern half of
that continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>A description of these Negroids and Mongoloids
and their derivatives, as well as of certain aberrant
species of man, lies outside the scope of
this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the structure of the head hair of all races
of mankind we find a regular progression from
extreme kinkiness to lanky straightness and this
straightness or curliness depends on the shape of
the cross section of the hair itself. This cross
section has three distinct forms, corresponding
with the most extreme divergences among human
species.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The cross section of the hair of the Negroes is
a flat ellipse with the result that they all have
kinky hair. This kinkiness of the Negroes’ hair is
also due somewhat to the acute angle at which the
hair is set into the skin and the peppercorn form
of hair probably represents an extreme specialization.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cross section of the hair of the Mongols
and their derivatives, the Amerinds, is a complete
circle and their hair is perfectly straight and lank.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cross section of the hair of the so-called
Caucasians, including the Mediterranean, Alpine
and Nordic subspecies, is an oval ellipse and consequently
is intermediate between the cross-sections
of the Negroes and Mongoloids. Hair of
this structure is wavy or curly, never either kinky
or absolutely straight and is characteristic of all the
European populations almost without exception.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these three hair types the straighter forms
most closely represent the earliest human form of
hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have confined the discussion to the most
important characters but there are many other
valuable aids to classification to be found in the
proportions of the body and the relative length
of the limbs. In this latter respect, it is a matter
of common knowledge that there occur two distinct
types, the one long legged and short bodied,
the other long bodied and short legged.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Without going into further physical details, it is
probable that all relative proportions in the body,
the features, the skeleton and the skull which are
fixed and constant and lie outside of the range of
individual variation represent dim inheritances
from the past. Every generation of human beings
carries the blood of thousands of ancestors, stretching
back through thousands of years, superimposed
upon a prehuman inheritance of still greater
antiquity and the face and body of every living
man offer an intricate mass of hieroglyphs that
science will some day learn to read and interpret.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only the foregoing main characters will be used
as the basis for determining race and attention
will be called later to such temperamental and
spiritual traits as seem to be associated with distinct
physical types.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall discuss only European populations and,
as said, shall not deal with exotic and alien races
scattered among them nor with those quarters of
the globe where the races of man are such that
other physical characters must be called upon to
provide clear definitions.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fascinating subject would open up if we were
to dwell upon the effect of racial combinations and
disharmonies, as, for instance, where the mixed
Nordic and Alpine populations of Lombardy usually
retain the skull shape, hair color and stature
of the Alpine race, with the light eye color of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Nordic race, or where the mountain populations
along the east coast of the Adriatic from the Tyrol
to Albania have the stature of the Nordic race and
an Alpine skull and coloration.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>III<br /> <span class='large'>RACE AND HABITAT</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The laws which govern the distribution of the
various races of man and their evolution through
selection are substantially the same as those controlling
the evolution and distribution of the
larger mammals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man, however, with his superior mentality has
freed himself from many of the conditions which
impose restraint upon the expansion of animals.
In his case selection through disease and social
and economic competition has largely replaced selection
through adjustment to the limitations of
food supply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man is the most cosmopolitan of animals and in
one form or another thrives in the tropics and in
the arctics, at sea level and on high plateaux, in
the desert and in the reeking forests of the equator.
Nevertheless, the various races of Europe
have each a certain natural habitat in which it
achieves its highest development.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Nordic Habitat</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The Nordics appear in their present centre of
distribution, the basin of the Baltic, at the close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of the Paleolithic, as soon as the retreating glaciers
left habitable land. This race was probably at
that time in possession of its fundamental characters,
and its extension from the plains of Russia
to Scandinavia was not in the nature of a radical
change of environment. The race in consequence
is now, always has been and probably always will
be, adjusted to certain environmental conditions,
chief of which is protection from a tropical sun.
The actinic rays of the sun at the same latitude
are uniform in strength the world over and continuous
sunlight affects adversely the delicate
nervous organization of the Nordics. The fogs
and long winter nights of the North serve as a protection
from too much sun and from its too direct
rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarcely less important is the presence of a
large amount of moisture but above all a constant
variety of temperature is needed. Sharp contrast
between night and day temperature and between
summer and winter are necessary to maintain the
vigor of the Nordic race at a high pitch. Uniform
weather, if long continued, lessens its energy. Too
great extremes as in midwinter or midsummer in
parts of New England are injurious. Limited but
constant alternations of heat and cold, of moisture
and dryness, of sun and clouds, of calm and cyclonic
storms offer the ideal surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the environment is too soft and luxurious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and no strife is required for survival, not only are
weak strains and individuals allowed to survive
and encouraged to breed but the strong types also
grow fat mentally and physically, like overfed
Indians on reservations or wingless birds on
oceanic islands, which have lost the power of flight
as a result of prolonged protective conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men of the Nordic race may not enjoy the
fogs and snows of the North, the endless changes
of weather and the violent fluctuations of the
thermometer and they may seek the sunny southern
isles, but under the former conditions they
flourish, do their work and raise their families.
In the south they grow listless and cease to breed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the lower classes in the Southern States of
America the increasing proportion of “poor whites”
and “crackers” are symptoms of lack of climatic
adjustment. The whites in Georgia, in the Bahamas
and, above all, in Barbadoes are excellent
examples of the deleterious effects of residence outside
the natural habitat of the Nordic race.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poor whites of the Cumberland Mountains
in Kentucky and Tennessee present a more difficult
problem, because here the altitude, even
though moderate, should modify the effects of latitude
and the climate of these mountains cannot
be particularly unfavorable to men of Nordic
breed. There are probably other hereditary forces
at work there as yet little understood.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>No doubt bad food and economic conditions,
prolonged inbreeding and the loss through emigration
of the best elements have played a large
part in the degeneration of these mountaineers.
They represent to a large extent the offspring of
indentured servants brought over by the rich
planters in early Colonial times and their names
indicate that many of them are the descendants of
the old borderers along the Scotch and English
frontier. The persistence with which family feuds
are maintained certainly points to such an origin.
The physical type is typically Nordic, for the
most part pure Saxon or Anglian, and the whole
mountain population show somewhat aberrant but
very pronounced physical, moral and mental characteristics
which would repay scientific investigation.
The problem is too complex to be disposed
of by reference to the hookworm, illiteracy or
competition with Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This type played a large part in the settlement
of the Middle West, by way of Kentucky, Tennessee
and Missouri. Thence they passed both up
the Missouri River and down the Santa Fé trail
and contributed rather more than their share of
the train robbers, horse thieves and bad men of
the West.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scotland and the Bahamas are inhabited by
men of precisely the same race, but the vigor of
the English in the Bahamas is gone and the beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of their women has faded. The fact that they
were not in competition with an autochthonous
race better adjusted to climatic conditions has
enabled them to survive, but the type could not
have persisted, even during the last two hundred
years, if they had been compelled to compete on
terms of equality with a native and acclimated
population.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another element entering into racial degeneration
on many other islands and for that matter
in many New England villages, is the loss through
emigration of the more vigorous and energetic
individuals, leaving behind the less efficient to
continue the race at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>In subtropical countries where the energy of
the Nordics is at a low ebb it would appear that
the racial inheritance of physical strength and
mental vigor was suppressed and recessive rather
than destroyed. Many individuals born in unfavorable
climatic surroundings, who move back to
the original habitat of their race in the north, recover
their full quota of energy and vigor. New
York and other Northern cities have many Southerners
who are fully as efficient as pure Northerners.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Nordic race can exist outside of its native
environment as land owning aristocrats who are
not required to do manual labor in the fields under
a blazing sun. As such an aristocracy it continues
to exist under Italian skies, but as a field laborer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the man of Nordic blood cannot compete with
his Alpine or Mediterranean rival. It is not to
be supposed that the various Nordic tribes and
armies, which for a thousand years after the fall of
Rome poured down from the Alps like the glaciers
to melt in the southern sun, were composed solely
of knights and gentlemen who became the landed
nobility of Italy. The man in the ranks also took
up his land and work in Italy, but he had to compete
directly with the native under climatic conditions
which were unfavorable to his race. In this
competition the blue eyed Nordic giant died and
the native survived. His officer, however, lived in
the castle and directed the labor of his bondsmen
without other preoccupation than the chase and
war and he long maintained his vigor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same thing happened in our South before
the Civil War. There the white men did not
work in the fields or in the factory. The heavy
work under the blazing sun was carried on by
Negro slaves and the planter was spared exposure
to an unfavorable environment. Under
these conditions he was able to retain much of his
vigor. When slavery was abolished and the
white man had to plough his own fields or work
in the factory deterioration began.</p>

<p class='c007'>The change in type of the men who are now
sent by the Southern States to represent them in
the Federal Government from their predecessors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in ante-bellum times is partly due to these causes,
but in greater degree it is to be attributed to the
fact that a large portion of the best racial strains
in the South were killed off during the Civil War.
In addition the war shattered the aristocratic
traditions which formerly secured the selection of
the best men as rulers. The new democratic ideals,
with universal suffrage in free operation among
the whites, result in the choice of representatives
who lack the distinction and ability of the leaders
of the Old South.</p>

<p class='c007'>A race may be thoroughly adjusted to a certain
country at one stage of its development and
be at a disadvantage when an economic change
occurs, such as was experienced in England a century
ago when the nation changed from an agricultural
to a manufacturing community. The type
of man that flourishes in the fields is not the type
of man that thrives in the factory, just as the
type of man required for the crew of a sailing
ship is not the type useful as stokers on a modern
steamer.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Habitat of the Alpines and Mediterraneans</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The environment of the Alpine race seems to
have always been the mountainous country of
central and eastern Europe, as well as western
Asia, but they are now spreading into the plains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>notably in Poland and Russia. This type has
never flourished in the deserts of Arabia or the
Sahara, nor has it succeeded well in maintaining
its early colonies in the northwest of Europe within
the domain of the Nordic long heads. It is,
however, a sturdy and persistent stock and, while
much of it may not be overrefined or cultured, undoubtedly
possesses great potentialities for future
development.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpines in the west of Europe, especially
in Switzerland and the districts immediately surrounding,
have been so thoroughly Nordicized and
so saturated with the culture of the adjoining nations
that they stand in sharp contrast to backward
Alpines of Slavic speech in the Balkans and
east of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mediterranean race, on the other hand, is
clearly a southern type with eastern affinities.
It is a type that did not endure in the north of
Europe under former agricultural conditions nor is
it suitable to the farming districts and frontiers
of America and Canada. It is adjusted to subtropical
and tropical countries better than any
other European type and will flourish in our
Southern States and around the coasts of the Spanish
Main. In France it is well known that members
of the Mediterranean race are better adapted
for colonization in Algeria than are French Alpines
or Nordics. This subspecies of man is notoriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>intolerant of extreme cold, owing to its susceptibility
to diseases of the lungs and it shrinks from
the blasts of the northern winter in which the Nordics
revel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brunet Mediterranean element in the native
American seems to be increasing at the expense of
the blond Nordic element generally throughout the
Southern States and probably also in the large
cities. This type of man, however, is scarce on
our frontiers. In the Northwest and in Alaska in
the days of the gold rush it was in the mining
camps a matter of comment if a man turned up
with dark eyes, so universal were blue and gray
eyes among the American pioneers.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE COMPETITION OF RACES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Where two races occupy a country side by side,
it is not correct to speak of one type as changing
into the other. Even if present in equal numbers
one of the two contrasted types will have some
small advantage or capacity which the other
lacks toward a perfect adjustment to surroundings.
Those possessing these favorable variations
will flourish at the expense of their rivals and
their offspring will not only be more numerous,
but will also tend to inherit such variations. In
this way one type gradually breeds the other out.
In this sense, and in this sense only, do races
change.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man continuously undergoes selection through
the operation of the forces of social environment.
Among native Americans of the Colonial period
a large family was an asset and social pressure
and economic advantage counselled both early
marriage and numerous children. Two hundred
years of continuous political expansion and material
prosperity changed these conditions and children,
instead of being an asset to till the fields and guard
the cattle, became an expensive liability. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>now require support, education and endowment
from their parents and a large family is regarded
by some as a serious handicap in the social struggle.</p>

<p class='c007'>These conditions do not obtain at first among
immigrants, and large families among the newly
arrived population are still the rule, precisely as
they were in Colonial America and are to-day in
French Canada where backwoods conditions still
prevail.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result is that one class or type in a population
expands more rapidly than another and ultimately
replaces it. This process of replacement
of one type by another does not mean that the
race changes or is transformed into another. It
is a replacement pure and simple and not a transformation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lowering of the birth rate among the most
valuable classes, while the birth rate of the lower
classes remains unaffected, is a frequent phenomenon
of prosperity. Such a change becomes
extremely injurious to the race if unchecked, unless
nature is allowed to maintain by her own cruel
devices the relative numbers of the different classes
in their due proportions. To attack race suicide
by encouraging indiscriminate reproduction is not
only futile but is dangerous if it leads to an increase
in the undesirable elements. What is needed in the
community most of all is an increase in the desirable
classes, which are of superior type physically,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>intellectually and morally and not merely an increase
in the absolute numbers of the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The value and efficiency of a population are not
numbered by what the newspapers call souls, but
by the proportion of men of physical and intellectual
vigor. The small Colonial population of
America was, on an average and man for man, far
superior to the present inhabitants, although the
latter are twenty-five times more numerous. The
ideal in eugenics toward which statesmanship should
be directed is, of course, improvement in quality
rather than quantity. This, however, is at present
a counsel of perfection and we must face conditions
as they are.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small birth rate in the upper classes is to
some extent offset by the care received by such
children as are born and the better chance they
have to become adult and breed in their turn. The
large birth rate of the lower classes is under normal
conditions offset by a heavy infant mortality,
which eliminates the weaker children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where altruism, philanthropy or sentimentalism
intervene with the noblest purpose and forbid nature
to penalize the unfortunate victims of reckless
breeding, the multiplication of inferior types is
encouraged and fostered. Indiscriminate efforts
to preserve babies among the lower classes often
result in serious injury to the race. At the existing
stage of civilization, the legalizing of birth control
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>would probably be of benefit by reducing the number
of offspring in the undesirable classes. Regulation
of the number of children is, for good or evil,
in full operation among the better classes and its
recognition by the state would result in no further
harm among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mistaken regard for what are believed to be
divine laws and a sentimental belief in the sanctity
of human life tend to prevent both the elimination
of defective infants and the sterilization of such
adults as are themselves of no value to the community.
The laws of nature require the obliteration
of the unfit and human life is valuable only
when it is of use to the community or race.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is highly unjust that a minute minority should
be called upon to supply brains for the unthinking
mass of the community, but it is even worse to burden
the responsible and larger but still overworked
elements in the community with an ever increasing
number of moral perverts, mental defectives and
hereditary cripples. As the percentage of incompetents
increases, the burden of their support will
become ever more onerous until, at no distant date,
society will in self-defense put a stop to the supply
of feebleminded and criminal children of weaklings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The church assumes a serious responsibility
toward the future of the race whenever it steps in
and preserves a defective strain. The marriage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>deaf mutes was hailed a generation ago as a triumph
of humanity. Now it is recognized as an
absolute crime against the race. A great injury is
done to the community by the perpetuation of
worthless types. These strains are apt to be meek
and lowly and as such make a strong appeal to
the sympathies of the successful. Before eugenics
were understood much could be said from a Christian
and humane viewpoint in favor of indiscriminate
charity for the benefit of the individual. The
societies for charity, altruism or extension of
rights, should have in these days, however, in their
management some small modicum of brains, otherwise
they may continue to do, as they have sometimes
done in the past, more injury to the race than
black death or smallpox.</p>

<p class='c007'>As long as such charitable organizations confine
themselves to the relief of suffering individuals,
no matter how criminal or diseased they may be,
no harm is done except to our own generation and
if modern society recognizes a duty to the humblest
malefactors or imbeciles that duty can be harmlessly
performed in full, provided they be deprived
of the capacity to procreate their defective strain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who read these pages will feel that there
is little hope for humanity, but the remedy has been
found, and can be quickly and mercifully applied.
A rigid system of selection through the elimination
of those who are weak or unfit—in other words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>social failures—would solve the whole question in
a century, as well as enable us to get rid of the
undesirables who crowd our jails, hospitals and
insane asylums. The individual himself can be
nourished, educated and protected by the community
during his lifetime, but the state through
sterilization must see to it that his line stops with
him or else future generations will be cursed with
an ever increasing load of victims of misguided sentimentalism.
This is a practical, merciful and inevitable
solution of the whole problem and can be
applied to an ever widening circle of social discards,
beginning always with the criminal, the diseased
and the insane and extending gradually to
types which may be called weaklings rather than
defectives and perhaps ultimately to worthless
race types.</p>

<p class='c007'>Efforts to increase the birth rate of the genius
producing classes of the community, while most
desirable, encounter great difficulties. In such
efforts we encounter social conditions over which
we have as yet no control. It was tried two thousand
years ago by Augustus and his efforts to
avert race suicide and the extinction of the old Roman
stock were singularly prophetic of what some
far seeing men are attempting in order to preserve
the race of native Americans of Colonial descent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man has the choice of two methods of race improvement.
He can breed from the best or he can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>eliminate the worst by segregation or sterilization.
The first method was adopted by the Spartans,
who had for their national ideals military efficiency
and the virtues of self-control, and along these
lines the results were completely successful. Under
modern social conditions it would be extremely
difficult in the first instance to determine which
were the most desirable types, except in the most
general way and even if a satisfactory selection
were finally made, it would be in a democracy a
virtual impossibility to limit by law the right to
breed to a privileged and chosen few.</p>

<p class='c007'>Interesting efforts to improve the quality as well
as the quantity of the population, however, will
probably be made in more than one country after
the war has ended.</p>

<p class='c007'>Experiments in limiting reproduction to the undesirable
classes were unconsciously made in mediæval
Europe under the guidance of the church.
After the fall of Rome social conditions were such
that all those who loved a studious and quiet life
were compelled to seek refuge from the violence of
the times in monastic institutions and upon such
the church imposed the obligation of celibacy and
thus deprived the world of offspring from these
desirable classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Middle Ages, through persecution resulting
in actual death, life imprisonment and banishment,
the free thinking, progressive and intellectual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>elements were persistently eliminated over
large areas, leaving the perpetuation of the race to
be carried on by the brutal, the servile and the
stupid. It is now impossible to say to what extent
the Roman Church by these methods has impaired
the brain capacity of Europe, but in Spain
alone, for a period of over three centuries from the
years 1471 to 1781, the Inquisition condemned to the
stake or imprisonment an average of 1,000 persons
annually. During these three centuries no less
than 32,000 were burned alive and 291,000 were
condemned to various terms of imprisonment and
other penalties and 17,000 persons were burned in
effigy, representing men who had died in prison or
had fled the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>No better method of eliminating the genius producing
strains of a nation could be devised and
if such were its purpose the result was eminently
satisfactory, as is demonstrated by the superstitious
and unintelligent Spaniard of to-day. A similar
elimination of brains and ability took place in
northern Italy, in France and in the Low Countries,
where hundreds of thousands of Huguenots were
murdered or driven into exile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under existing conditions the most practical
and hopeful method of race improvement is through
the elimination of the least desirable elements in
the nation by depriving them of the power to contribute
to future generations. It is well known to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>stock breeders that the color of a herd of cattle can
be modified by continuous destruction of worthless
shades and of course this is true of other characters.
Black sheep, for instance, have been practically
obliterated by cutting out generation after
generation all animals that show this color phase,
until in carefully maintained flocks a black individual
only appears as a rare sport.</p>

<p class='c007'>In mankind it would not be a matter of great
difficulty to secure a general consensus of public
opinion as to the least desirable, let us say, ten per
cent of the community. When this unemployed
and unemployable human residuum has been eliminated
together with the great mass of crime, poverty,
alcoholism and feeblemindedness associated
therewith it would be easy to consider the advisability
of further restricting the perpetuation of
the then remaining least valuable types. By this
method mankind might ultimately become sufficiently
intelligent to choose deliberately the most
vital and intellectual strains to carry on the race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to selection by climatic environment
man is now, and has been for ages, undergoing
selection through disease. He has been decimated
throughout the centuries by pestilences such
as the black death and bubonic plague. In our
fathers’ days yellow fever and smallpox cursed
humanity. These plagues are now under control,
but similar diseases now regarded as mere nuisances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to childhood, such as measles, mumps and
scarlatina, are terrible scourges to native populations
without previous experience with them. Add
to these smallpox and other white men’s diseases
and one has the great empire builders of yesterday.
It was not the swords in the hands of
Columbus and his followers that decimated the
American Indians, it was the germs that his men
and their successors brought over, implanting the
white man’s maladies in the red man’s world.
Long before the arrival of the Puritans in New
England, smallpox had flickered up and down the
coast until the natives were but a broken remnant
of their former numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the present time the Nordic race is undergoing
selection through alcoholism, a peculiarly
Nordic vice, and through consumption. Both
these dread scourges unfortunately attack those
members of the race that are otherwise most desirable,
differing in this respect from filth diseases
like typhus, typhoid or smallpox. One has only
to look among the more desirable classes for the
victims of rum and tubercule to realize that
death or mental and physical impairment through
these two causes have cost the race many of its
most brilliant and attractive members.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>V<br /> <span class='large'>RACE, LANGUAGE AND NATIONALITY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Nationality is an artificial political grouping
of population usually centring around a single
language as an expression of traditions and aspirations.
Nationality can, however, exist independently
of language but states thus formed, such as
Belgium or Austria, are far less stable than those
where a uniform language is prevalent, as, for example,
France or England.</p>

<p class='c007'>States without a single national language are
constantly exposed to disintegration, especially
where a substantial minority of the inhabitants
speak a tongue which is predominant in an adjoining
state and, as a consequence, tend to gravitate
toward such state.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the last century in Europe has
been the record of a long series of struggles to unite
in one political unit all those speaking the same
or closely allied dialects. With the exception of
internal and social revolutions, every European
war since the Napoleonic period has been caused
by the effort to bring about the unification either
of Italy or of Germany or by the desperate attempts
of the Balkan States to struggle out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Turkish chaos into modern European nations on a
basis of community of language. The unification
of both Italy and Germany is as yet incomplete according
to the views held by their more advanced
patriots and the solution of the Balkan question
is still in the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men are keenly aware of their nationality and
are very sensitive about their language, but only
in a few cases, notably in Sweden and Germany,
does any large section of the population possess
anything analogous to true race consciousness, although
the term “race” is everywhere misused to
designate linguistic or political groups.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unifying power of a common language works
subtly and unceasingly. In the long run it forms a
bond which draws peoples together—as the English-speaking
peoples of the British Empire with those
of America. In the same manner this linguistic
sympathy will bring the German-speaking Austrians
into a closer political community with the rest
of Germany and will hold together all the German-speaking
provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>It sometimes happens that a section of the population
of a large nation gathers around language,
reinforced by religion, as an expression of individuality.
The struggle between the French-speaking
Alpine Walloons and the Nordic Flemings of Low
Dutch tongue in Belgium is an example of two
competing languages in an artificial nation which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>was formed originally around religion. On the
other hand, the Irish National movement centres
chiefly around religion reinforced by myths of
ancient grandeur. The French Canadians and
the Poles use both religion and language to hold
together what they consider a political unit. None
of these so-called nationalities are founded on race.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the past century side by side with the tendency
to form imperial or large national groups,
such as the Pan-Germanic, Pan-Slavic, Pan-Rumanian
or Italia Irredenta movements, there has
appeared a counter movement on the part of small
disintegrating “nationalities” to reassert themselves,
such as the Bohemian, Bulgarian, Serbian,
Irish, and Egyptian national revivals. The upheaval
is usually caused, as in the cases of the Irish
and the Serbians, by delusions of former greatness
now become national obsessions, but sometimes it
means the resistance of a small group of higher culture
to absorption by a lower civilization. The
reassertion of these small nationalities is associated
with the resurgence of the lower races at the
expense of the Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examples of a high type threatened by a lower
culture are afforded by the Finlanders, who are trying
to escape the dire fate of their neighbors across
the Gulf of Finland—the Russification of the Germans
and Swedes of the Baltic Provinces—and by
the struggle of the Danes of Schleswig to escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Germanization. The Armenians, too, have resisted
stoutly the pressure of Islam to force them
away from their ancient Christian faith. This
people really represents the last outpost of Europe
toward the Mohammedan East and constitutes
the best remaining medium through which
Western ideals and culture can be introduced into
Asia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these as in other cases, the process of absorption
from the viewpoint of the world at large is
good or evil exactly in proportion to the relative
value of the culture and race of the two groups.
The world would be no richer in civilization with
an independent Bohemia or an enlarged Rumania;
but, on the contrary, an independent Hungarian nation
strong enough to stand alone, a Finland self-governing
or reunited to Sweden, or an enlarged
Greece would add greatly to the forces that make
for good government and progress. An independent
Ireland worked out on a Tammany model
is not a pleasing prospect. A free Poland, apart
from its value as a buffer state, might be actually a
step backward. Poland was once great, but the
elements that made it so are scattered and gone
and the Poland of to-day is a geographical expression
and nothing more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prevailing lack of true race consciousness
is probably due to the fact that every important
nation in Europe as at present organized, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>sole exception of the Iberian and Scandinavian
states, possesses in large proportions representatives
of at least two of the fundamental European
subspecies of man and of all manner of crosses between
them. In France to-day, as in Cæsar’s
Gaul, the three races divide the nation in unequal
proportions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the future, however, with an increased knowledge
of the correct definition of true human races
and types and with a recognition of the immutability
of fundamental racial characters and of the
results of mixed breeding, far more value will be
attached to racial in contrast to national or linguistic
affinities. In marital relations the consciousness
of race will also play a much larger part
than at present, although in the social sphere we
shall have to contend with a certain strange attraction
for contrasted types. When it becomes thoroughly
understood that the children of mixed marriages
between contrasted races belong to the lower
type, the importance of transmitting in unimpaired
purity the blood inheritance of ages will be
appreciated at its full value and to bring half-breeds
into the world will be regarded as a social
and racial crime of the first magnitude. The laws
against miscegenation must be greatly extended
if the higher races are to be maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The language that a man speaks may be nothing
more than evidence that at some time in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>past his race has been in contact, either as conqueror
or as conquered, with its original possessors.
Postulating the Nordic origin and dissemination
of the Proto-Aryan language, then in Asia
and elsewhere existing Aryan speech on the lips
of populations showing no sign of Nordic characters
is to be considered evidence of a former dominance
of Nordics now long vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>One has only to consider the spread of the language
of Rome over the vast extent of her Empire
to realize how few of those who speak to-day
Romance tongues derive any portion of their blood
from the pure Latin stock and the error of talking
about a “Latin race” becomes evident.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is, however, such a thing as a large group
of nations which have a mutual understanding and
sympathy based on the possession of a common
or closely related group of languages and on the
culture of which it is the medium. This assemblage
maybe called the “Latin nations,” but never the
“Latin race.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Latin America” is a still greater misnomer
as the great mass of the populations of South
and Central America is not even European and
still less “Latin,” being overwhelmingly of Amerindian
blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Teutonic group a large majority of those
who speak Teutonic languages, as the English,
Flemings, Dutch, North Germans and Scandinavians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>are descendants of the Nordic race while
the dominant class in Europe is everywhere of
that blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the so-called “Celtic race,” the fantastic
inapplicability of the term is at once apparent
when we consider that those populations on the
borders of the Atlantic Ocean, who to-day speak
Celtic dialects, are divided into three groups, each
one showing in great purity the characters of one of
the three entirely distinct human subspecies found
in Europe. To class together the Breton peasant
with his round Alpine skull; the little, long skulled,
brunet Welshman of Mediterranean race, and
the tall, blond, light-eyed Scottish Highlander of
pure Nordic blood, in a single group labelled Celtic
is obviously impossible. These peoples have neither
physical, mental nor cultural characteristics
in common. If one be of “Celtic” blood then the
other two are clearly of different origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was once a people who used the original
Celtic language and they formed the western vanguard
of the Nordic race. This people was spread
all over central and western Europe prior to the irruption
of the Teutonic tribes and were, no doubt,
much mixed with Alpines among the lower classes.
The descendants of these Celts must be sought to-day
among those having the characters of the
Nordic race and not elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England the short, dark Mediterranean Welshman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>talks about being “Celtic,” quite unconscious
that he is the residuum of Pre-Nordic races of immense
antiquity. If the Celts are Mediterranean
in race then they are absent from central Europe
and we must regard as Celts all the Berbers and
Egyptians, as well as many Persians and Hindus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In France many anthropologists regard the
Breton of Alpine blood in the same light and
ignore his remote Asiatic origin. If these Alpine
Bretons are Celts then there is no substantial
trace of their blood, in the British Isles, as round
skulls are practically absent there and all the
blond elements in England, Scotland and Ireland
must be attributed to the historic Teutonic invasions.
Furthermore, we must call all the continental
Alpines “Celts,” and must also include all
Slavs, Armenians and other brachycephs of western
Asia within that designation, which would be
obviously grotesque. The fact that the original
Celts left their speech on the tongues of Mediterraneans
in Wales and of Alpines in Brittany must
not mislead us, as it indicates nothing more than
that Celtic speech antedates the Anglo-Saxons in
England and the Romans in France. We must
once and for all time discard the name “Celt”
for any existing race whatever and speak only of
“Celtic” language and culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Ireland the big, blond Nordic Danes claim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the honor of the name of “Celt,” if honor it be,
but they are fully as Nordic as the English and
the great mass of the Irish are of Danish, Norse
and Anglo-Norman blood in addition to earlier
and Pre-Nordic elements. We are all familiar with
the blond and the brunet type of Irishman. These
represent precisely the same racial elements as
those which enter into the composition of the
English, namely, the tall Nordic blond and the
little Mediterranean brunet pure or combined with
Paleolithic remnants. The Irish are consequently
not entitled to independent national existence on
the ground of race, but if there be any ground for
political separation from England it must rest like
that of Belgium on religion, a basis for political
combinations now happily obsolete in communities
well advanced in culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of the so-called “Slavic race,” there
is much more unity between racial type and language.
It is true that in most Slavic-speaking
countries the predominant race is clearly Alpine,
except perhaps in Russia where there is a very
large substratum of Nordic type—which may be
considered as Proto-Nordic. The objection which
is made to the identification of the Slavic race
with the Alpine type rests chiefly on the fact that
a very large portion of the Alpine race is German-speaking
in Germany, Italian-speaking in Italy
and French-speaking in central France. Moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>large portions of Rumania are of exactly the same
racial complexion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the modern Greeks are also Alpines; in
fact, are little more than Byzantinized Slavs. It
was through the Byzantine Empire that the Slavs
first came in contact with the Mediterranean world
and through this Greek medium the Russians, the
Serbians, the Rumanians and the Bulgarians received
their Christianity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Situated on the eastern marches of Europe, the
Slavs were submerged during long periods in the
Middle Ages by Mongolian hordes and were
checked in development and warped in culture.
Definite traces remain of the blood of the Mongols
both in isolated and compact groups in south Russia
and also scattered throughout the whole country as
far west as the German boundary. The high tide
of the Mongol invasion was during the thirteenth
century. Three hundred years later the great Muscovite
expansion began, first over the steppes to
the Urals and then across Siberian tundras and
forests to the waters of the Pacific, taking up in
its course much Mongolian blood, especially during
the early stages of its advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term “Caucasian race” has ceased to have
any meaning except where it is used, in the
United States, to contrast white populations with
Negroes or Indians or in the Old World with Mongols.
It is, however, a convenient term to include
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the three European subspecies when considered as
divisions of one of the primary branches or species
of mankind but it is, at best, a cumbersome and
archaic designation. The name “Caucasian” arose
a century ago from a false assumption that the
cradle of the blond Europeans was in the Caucasus
where no traces are now found of any such
race, except a small and decreasing minority of
blond traits among the Ossetes, a tribe whose
Aryan speech is related to that of the Armenians,
and who while mainly brachycephalic still retain
some blond and dolichocephalic elements which
apparently are fading fast. The Ossetes now have
about thirty per cent fair eyes and ten per cent fair
hair. They are supposed to be to some extent a
remnant of the Alans, the easternmost Teutonic
tribe and closely related to the Goths. Both Alans
and Goths very early in the Christian era occupied
southern Russia, and were the latest known Nordics
in the vicinity of the Caucasus Mountains. If
these Ossetes are not partly of Alan origin they
may possibly represent the last lingering trace of
ancient Scythian dolichocephalic blondness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The phrase “Indo-European or Indo-Germanic
race” is also of little use. If it has any meaning
at all it must include all the three European races
as well as members of the Mediterranean race in
Persia and India. The use of this name also involves
a false assumption of blood relationship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>between the north European populations and the
Hindus, because of their possession in common of
Aryan speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>The name “Aryan race” must also be frankly discarded
as a term of racial significance. It is to-day
purely linguistic, although there was at one time, of
course, an identity between the original Proto-Aryan
mother tongue and the race that first spoke
and developed it. In short, there is not nor has
there ever been either a Caucasian or an Indo-European
race, but there was once, thousands of years
ago, an original Aryan race long since vanished into
dim memories of the past. If used in a racial
sense other than as above, it should be limited to
the Nordic invaders of Hindustan now long extinct.
The great lapse of time since the disappearance of
the ancient Aryan race as such is measured by
the extreme disintegration of the various groups of
Aryan languages. These linguistic divergences are
chiefly due to the imposition by conquest of Aryan
speech upon several distinct subspecies of man
throughout western Asia and Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be pertinent before leaving this subject
to point out that, as a whole, “Germans,”
“French,” and “English,” as certain populations
are now called, are but little more entitled to be
considered the direct descendants, or even the exclusive
modern representatives, of the ancient Germans,
Franks or Anglo-Saxons, than are the living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Italians or Greeks to be regarded as the offspring
of the Romans of the days of the Republic or the
Hellenes of the classic period. There are, of course,
many individuals and groups, perhaps even classes,
in each of these nations, who do accurately represent
the race from which the national name was derived.
The Scandinavians, on the other hand, are
racially what they were two thousand years ago,
though diminished somewhat in race vigor by the
loss through the emigration of some of their more
enterprising members. Meanwhile, at the other
end of Europe, the modern Spaniard probably more
closely represents the Iberians before the arrival
of the Gauls than did the Spaniard of five hundred
years ago.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>VI<br /> <span class='large'>RACE AND LANGUAGE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When a country is invaded and conquered by a
race speaking a foreign language, one of several
things may happen: replacement of both population
and language, as in the case of eastern
England when conquered by the Saxons or adoption
of the language of the victors by the natives,
as happened in Roman Gaul, where the invaders
imposed their Latin tongue throughout the land
without substantially altering the race.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Romans probably modified the race in Gaul
by killing a much larger proportion of the Nordic
fighting classes than of the more submissive Alpines
and Mediterraneans. This is confirmed by the
fact that when the prolonged and brilliant resistance
to Cæsar’s legions was finally broken, no serious
attempt was ever again made to throw off the Roman
yoke and a few centuries later the Teutonic
invaders encountered no determined opposition
from the inhabitants when they entered and
occupied the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England and Scotland later conquerors, Norsemen,
Danes and Normans, failed to change radically
the Saxon speech of the country and in Gaul the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Teutonic tongues of the Franks, Burgundians and
Northmen could not displace the language of
Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>Autochthonous inhabitants frequently impose
upon their invaders their own language and customs.
In Normandy the conquering Norse pirates
accepted the language, religion and customs
of the natives and in a century they vanish from
history as Scandinavian heathen and appear as the
foremost representatives of the speech and religion
of Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Hindustan the blond Nordic invaders forced
their Aryan language on the aborigines, but their
blood was quickly and utterly absorbed in the
darker strains of the original owners of the land.
A record of the desperate efforts of the conqueror
classes in India to preserve the purity of their
blood persists until this very day in their carefully
regulated system of castes. In our Southern States
Jim Crow cars and social discriminations have
exactly the same purpose and justification.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hindu to-day speaks a very ancient form of
Aryan language, but there remains not one recognizable
trace of the blood of the white conquerors
who poured in through the passes of the Northwest.
The boast of the modern Indian that he is
of the same race as his English ruler is entirely
without basis in fact and the little swarthy native
lives amid the monuments of a departed grandeur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>professing the religion and speaking the tongue of
his long-forgotten Nordic conquerors, without the
slightest claim to blood kinship. The dim and uncertain
traces of Nordic blood in northern India
only serve to emphasize the utter swamping of the
white man in the burning South.</p>

<p class='c007'>The power of racial resistance of a dense and
thoroughly acclimated population to an incoming
army is very great. No ethnic conquest can be
complete unless the natives are exterminated and
the invaders bring their own women with them.
If the conquerors are obliged to depend upon
the women of the vanquished to carry on the
race, the intrusive blood strain of the invaders
in a short time becomes diluted beyond recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>It sometimes happens that an infiltration of population
takes place either in the guise of unwilling
slaves or of willing immigrants, who fill up waste
places and take to the lowly tasks which the
lords of the land despise, thus gradually occupying
the country and literally breeding out their
masters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The former catastrophe happened in the declining
days of the Roman Republic and the south
Italians of to-day are very largely descendants of
the nondescript slaves of all races, chiefly from the
southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean,
who were imported by the Romans under the Empire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>to work their vast estates. The latter is occurring
to-day in many parts of America, especially
in New England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eastern half of Germany has a Slavic Alpine
substratum which represents the descendants of
the Wends, who first appear about the commencement
of the Christian era and who by the sixth
century had penetrated as far west as the Elbe,
occupying the lands left vacant by the Teutonic
tribes which had migrated southward. These
Wends in turn were Teutonized by a return wave of
military conquest from the tenth century onward,
and to-day their descendants are considered Germans
in good standing. Having adopted the German
as their sole tongue they are now in religious,
political and cultural sympathy with the pure
Teutons; in fact, they are quite unconscious of
any racial distinction.</p>

<p class='c007'>This historic fact underlies the ferocious controversy
which has been raised over the ethnic origin
of the Prussians, the issue being whether the populations
in Brandenburg, Silesia, Posen, West Prussia,
and other districts in eastern Germany, are
Alpine Wends or true Nordics. The truth is that
the dominant half of the population is purely Teutonic
and the remainder of the population are merely
Teutonized Wends and Poles of Alpine affinities.
Of course, these territories must also retain some
of their early Teutonic population and the blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of the Goth, Burgund, Vandal and Lombard, who
at the commencement of the Christian era were
located there, as well as of the later Saxon element,
must enter largely into the composition of the
Prussian of to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some anthropologists regard the Teutonized
round heads of south Germany as a distinct subdivision
of the Alpines because of the large percentage
of blond hair and still larger percentage of
light colored eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important communities in continental
Europe of pure German type are to be found in
old Saxony, the country around Hanover, and this
element prevails generally in the northwestern part
of the German Empire among the Low German-speaking
population, while the High German-speaking
population is largely composed of Teutonized
Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coasts of the North Sea extending from
Schleswig and Holstein into Holland are inhabited
by a very pure Nordic type known as the Frisians.
They are the handsomest and in many respects
the finest of the continental Nordics and are
closely related to the English, as many of the
Post-Roman invaders of England either came from
Frisia or from adjoining districts.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the states involved in the present world war
have sent to the front their fighting Nordic element
and the loss of life now going on in Europe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>will fall much more heavily on the blond giant than
on the little brunet.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in all wars since Roman times from a breeding
point of view the little dark man is the final winner.
No one who saw one of our regiments march
on its way to the Spanish War could fail to be impressed
with the size and blondness of the men in
the ranks as contrasted with the complacent citizen,
who from his safe stand on the gutter curb
gave his applause to the fighting man and then
stayed behind to perpetuate his own brunet type.
In the present war one has merely to study the
type of officer and of the man in the ranks to
realize that, in spite of the draft net, the Nordic race
is contributing an enormous majority of the fighting
men, out of all proportion to their relative
numbers in the nation at large.</p>

<p class='c007'>This same Nordic element, everywhere the type
of the sailor, the soldier, the adventurer and the
pioneer, was ever the type to migrate to new countries,
until the ease of transportation and the desire
to escape military service in the last forty years
reversed the immigrant tide. In consequence of
this change our immigrants now largely represent
lowly refugees from “persecution,” and other social
discards.</p>

<p class='c007'>In most cases the blood of pioneers has been lost
to their race. They did not take their women with
them. They either died childless or left half-breeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>behind them. The virile blood of the Spanish
conquistadores, who are now little more than a
memory in Central and South America, died out
from these causes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was also true in the early days of our
Western frontiersmen, who individually were a far
finer type than the settlers who followed them.
In fact, it is said that practically every one of the
Forty-Niners in California was of Nordic type.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE EUROPEAN RACES IN COLONIES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For reasons already set forth there are few communities
outside of Europe of pure European blood.
The racial destiny of Mexico and of the islands and
coasts of the Spanish Main is clear. The white man
is being rapidly bred out by Negroes on the islands
and by Indians on the mainland. It is quite evident
that the West Indies, the coast region of our
Gulf States, perhaps, also the black belt of the lower
Mississippi Valley must be abandoned to Negroes.
This transformation is already complete in Haiti
and is going rapidly forward in Cuba and Jamaica.
Mexico and the northern part of South America
must also be given over to native Indians with
an ever thinning veneer of white culture of the
“Latin” type.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Venezuela the pure whites number about one
per cent of the whole population, the balance being
Indians and various crosses between Indians, Negroes
and whites. In Jamaica the whites number
not more than two per cent, while the remainder are
Negroes or mulattoes. In Mexico the proportion
is larger, but the unmixed whites number less
than twenty per cent of the whole, the others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>being Indians pure or mixed. These latter are the
“greasers” of the American frontiersman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whenever the incentive to imitate the dominant
race is removed the Negro or, for that matter,
the Indian, reverts shortly to his ancestral grade
of culture. In other words, it is the individual
and not the race that is affected by religion, education
and example. Negroes have demonstrated
throughout recorded time that they are a stationary
species and that they do not possess the potentiality
of progress or initiative from within. Progress
from self-impulse must not be confounded
with mimicry or with progress imposed from without
by social pressure or by the slaver’s lash.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the impulse of an inferior race to imitate
or mimic the dress, manners or morals of the
dominant race is destroyed by the acquisition of
political or social independence, the servient race
tends to revert to its original status as in Haiti.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where two distinct species are located side by side
history and biology teach that but one of two things
can happen; either one race drives the other out, as
the Americans exterminated the Indians and as the
Negroes are now replacing the whites in various
parts of the South; or else they amalgamate and
form a population of race bastards in which the
lower type ultimately preponderates. This is a
disagreeable alternative with which to confront
sentimentalists but nature is only concerned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>results and neither makes nor takes excuses. The
chief failing of the day with some of our well meaning
philanthropists is their absolute refusal to face
inevitable facts, if such facts appear cruel.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Argentine white blood of the various
European races is pouring in so rapidly that a
community preponderantly white, but of the Mediterranean
race, may develop, but the type is suspiciously
swarthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Brazil, Negro blood together with that of
the native inhabitants is rapidly overwhelming the
white Europeans, although in the southern provinces
German immigration has played an important
rôle and the influx of Italians has also been considerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Asia, with the sole exception of the Russian
settlements in Siberia, there can be and will be no
ethnic conquest and all the white men in India,
the East Indies, the Philippines and China will
leave not the slightest trace behind them in the
blood of the native population. After several centuries
of contact and settlement the pure Spanish
in the Philippines are about half of one per cent.
The Dutch in their East Indian islands are even
less, while the resident whites in Hindustan amount
to about one-tenth of one per cent. Such numbers
are infinitesimal and of no force in a democracy, but
in a monarchy, if kept free from contamination, they
suffice for a ruling caste or a military aristocracy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Throughout history it is only the race of the leaders
that has counted and the most vigorous have been
in control and will remain in mastery in one
form or another until such time as democracy and
its illegitimate offspring, socialism, definitely establish
cacocracy and the rule of the worst and put
an end to progress. The salvation of humanity
will then lie in the chance survival of some sane
barbarians who may retain the basic truth that
inequality and not equality is the law of nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Australia and New Zealand, where the natives
have been virtually exterminated by the whites, are
developing into communities of pure Nordic blood
and will for that reason play a large part in the
future history of the Pacific. The bitter opposition
of the Australians and Californians to the admission
of Chinese coolies and Japanese farmers is
due primarily to a blind but absolutely justified
determination to keep those lands as white man’s
countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Africa, south of the Sahara, the density of the
native population will prevent the establishment
of any purely white communities, except at the
southern extremity of the continent and possibly
on portions of the plateaux of eastern Africa.
The stoppage of famines and wars and the abolition
of the slave trade, while dictated by the
noblest impulses of humanity, are suicidal to the
white man. Upon the removal of these natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>checks Negroes multiply so rapidly that there will
not be standing room on the continent for white
men, unless, perchance, the lethal sleeping sickness,
which attacks the natives far more frequently than
the whites, should run its course unchecked.</p>

<p class='c007'>In South Africa a community of mixed Dutch
and English extraction is developing. Here the
only difference is one of language. English, being
a world tongue, will inevitably prevail over the
Dutch patois called “Taal.” This Frisian dialect,
as a matter of fact, is closer to old Saxon or rather
Kentish than any living continental tongue and the
blood of the North Hollander is extremely close to
that of the Anglo-Saxon of England. The English
and the Dutch will merge in a common type just
as they have in the past two hundred years in the
Colony and State of New York. They must stand
together if they are to maintain any part of Africa
as a white man’s country, because they are confronted
with the menace of an enormous black
Bantu population which will drive out the whites
unless the problem is bravely faced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only possible solution is to establish large
colonies for the Negroes and to allow them outside
of them only as laborers and not as settlers. There
must be ultimately a black South Africa and a
white South Africa side by side or else a pure
black Africa from the Cape to the cataracts of the
Nile.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>In upper Canada, as in the United States up to
the time of our Civil War, the white population
was purely Nordic. The Dominion is, as a whole,
handicapped by the presence of an indigestible
mass of French Canadians, largely from Brittany
and of Alpine origin, although the habitant patois
is an archaic Norman of the time of Louis XIV.
These Frenchmen were granted freedom of language
and religion by their conquerors and are
now using those privileges to form separatist groups
in antagonism to the English population. The
Quebec Frenchmen will succeed in seriously impeding
the progress of Canada and will succeed
even better in keeping themselves a poor and
ignorant community of little more importance to
the world at large than are the Negroes in the South.
The selfishness of the Quebec Frenchmen is measured
by the fact that in the present war they will
not fight for the British Empire or for France or
even for clerical Belgium and they are now endeavoring
to make use of the military crisis to secure a
further extension of their “nationalistic ideals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Personally the writer believes that the finest and
purest type of a Nordic community outside of Europe
will develop in northwest Canada and on the
Pacific coast of the United States. Most of the
other countries in which the Nordic race is now
settling lie outside the special environment in which
alone it can flourish.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The Negroes of the United States while stationary,
were not a serious drag on civilization until
in the last century they were given the rights of citizenship
and were incorporated in the body politic.
These Negroes brought with them no language or
religion or customs of their own which persisted
but adopted all these elements of environment
from the dominant race, taking the names of their
masters just as to-day the German and Polish Jews
are assuming American names. They came for
the most part from the coasts of the Bight of
Benin, but some of the later ones came from the
southeast coast of Africa by way of Zanzibar.
They were of various black tribes but have been
from the beginning saturated with white blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking at any group of Negroes in America, especially
in the North, it is easy to see that while they
are all essentially Negroes, whether coal-black,
brown or yellow, a great many of them have varying
amounts of Nordic blood in them, which has
in some respects modified their physical structure
without transforming them in any way into white
men. This miscegenation was, of course, a frightful
disgrace to the dominant race but its effect on the
Nordics has been negligible, for the simple reason
that it was confined to white men crossing with
Negro women and did not involve the reverse process,
which would, of course, have resulted in the
infusion of Negro blood into the American stock.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The United States of America must be regarded
racially as a European colony and owing to current
ignorance of the physical bases of race, one
often hears the statement made that native Americans
of Colonial ancestry are of mixed ethnic
origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not true.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of the Revolutionary War the settlers
in the thirteen Colonies were overwhelmingly
Nordic, a very large majority being Anglo-Saxon
in the most limited meaning of that term. The
New England settlers in particular came from
those counties of England where the blood was
almost purely Saxon, Anglian, Norse and Dane.
The date of their migration was earlier than the
resurgence of the Mediterranean type that has so
greatly expanded in England during the last century
with the growth of manufacturing towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>New England during Colonial times and long
afterward was far more Nordic than old England;
that is, it contained a smaller percentage of
small, Pre-Nordic brunets. Any one familiar with
the native New Englander knows the clean cut face,
the high stature and the prevalence of gray and blue
eyes and light brown hair and recognizes that the
brunet element is less noticeable there than in the
South.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Southern States were populated also by
Englishmen of the purest Nordic type but there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to-day, except among the mountains, an appreciably
larger amount of brunet types than in the
North. Virginia is in the same latitude as North
Africa and south of this line no blonds have ever
been able to survive in full vigor, chiefly because
the actinic rays of the sun are the same regardless
of other climatic conditions. These rays beat
heavily on the Nordic race and disturb their nervous
system, wherever the white man ventures too
far from the cold and foggy North.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining Colonial elements, the Holland
Dutch and the Palatine Germans, who came over in
small numbers to New York and Pennsylvania,
were also largely Nordic, while many of the French
Huguenots who escaped to America were drawn
from the same racial element in France. The
Scotch-Irish, who were numerous on the frontier
of the middle Colonies were, of course, of pure
Scotch and English blood, although they had resided
in Ireland for two or three generations. They
were quite free from admixture with the earlier
Irish, from whom they were cut off socially by bitter
religious antagonism and they are not to be considered
as “Irish” in any sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no important immigration of other
elements until the middle of the nineteenth century
when Irish Catholic and German immigrants
appear for the first time upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordic blood was kept pure in the Colonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>because at that time among Protestant peoples
there was a strong race feeling, as a result of which
half-breeds between the white man and any native
type were regarded as natives and not as white
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was plenty of mixture with the Negroes as
the light color of many Negroes abundantly testifies,
but these mulattoes, quadroons or octoroons were
then and are now universally regarded as Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was also abundant cross breeding along
the frontiers between the white frontiersman and
the Indian squaw but the half-breed was everywhere
regarded as a member of the inferior race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Catholic colonies, however, of New France
and New Spain, if the half-breed were a good
Catholic he was regarded as a Frenchman or a
Spaniard, as the case might be. This fact alone
gives the clew to many of our Colonial wars where
the Indians, other than the Iroquois, were persuaded
to join the French against the Americans
by half-breeds who considered themselves Frenchmen.
The Church of Rome has everywhere used
its influence to break down racial distinctions. It
disregards origins and only requires obedience to
the mandates of the universal church. In that lies
the secret of the opposition of Rome to all national
movements. It maintains the imperial as contrasted
with the nationalistic ideal and in that respect
its inheritance is direct from the Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Race consciousness in the Colonies and in the
United States, down to and including the Mexican
War, seems to have been very strongly developed
among native Americans and it still remains in full
vigor to-day in the South, where the presence of a
large Negro population forces this question upon the
daily attention of the whites.</p>

<p class='c007'>In New England, however, whether through the
decline of Calvinism or the growth of altruism,
there appeared early in the last century a wave of
sentimentalism, which at that time took up the
cause of the Negro and in so doing apparently destroyed,
to a large extent, pride and consciousness
of race in the North. The agitation over slavery
was inimical to the Nordic race, because it thrust
aside all national opposition to the intrusion of
hordes of immigrants of inferior racial value and
prevented the fixing of a definite American type.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Civil War was fought almost entirely by
unalloyed native Americans. The Irish immigrants
were, at the middle of the last century,
confined to a few States and, being chiefly domestic
servants or day laborers, were of no social
importance. They gathered in the large cities
and by voting as a solid block for their own collective
benefit quickly demoralized the governments
of the municipalities in which they secured ascendancy.
The German immigrants who came to
America about the same time were chiefly enthusiasts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>who had taken part in the German Revolution
of ’48. In spite of the handicap of a strange language
they formed a more docile and educated
element than the Irish and were more prone to
scatter into the rural districts. Neither the Irish
nor the Germans played an important part in the
development or policies of the nation as a whole,
although in the Civil War they each contributed a
relatively large number of soldiers to the Northern
army. These Irish and German elements were for
the most part of the Nordic race and while they
did not in the least strengthen the nation either
morally or intellectually they did not impair its
physique.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been little or no Indian blood taken
into the veins of the native American, except in
States like Oklahoma and in some isolated families
scattered here and there in the Northwest. This
particular mixture will play no very important role
in future combinations of race on this continent,
except in the north of Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>The native American has always found and finds
now in the black men willing followers who ask
only to obey and to further the ideals and wishes
of the master race, without trying to inject into the
body politic their own views, whether racial, religious
or social. Negroes are never socialists or
labor unionists and as long as the dominant imposes
its will on the servient race and as long as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>they remain in the same relation to the whites as in
the past, the Negroes will be a valuable element in
the community but once raised to social equality
their influence will be destructive to themselves
and to the whites. If the purity of the two races
is to be maintained they cannot continue to live
side by side and this is a problem from which there
can be no escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>The native American by the middle of the nineteenth
century was rapidly acquiring distinct characteristics.
Derived from the Saxon and Danish
parts of the British Isles and being almost purely
Nordic he was by reason of a differential selection
due to a new environment beginning to show
physical peculiarities of his own slightly variant
from those of his English forefathers and corresponding
rather with the idealistic Elizabethan than
with the materialistic Hanoverian Englishman.
The Civil War, however, put a severe, perhaps
fatal, check to the development and expansion of
this splendid type by destroying great numbers of
the best breeding stock on both sides and by breaking
up the home ties of many more. If the war
had not occurred these same men with their descendants
would have populated the Western
States instead of the racial nondescripts who are
now flocking there.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is every reason to believe that the native
stock would have continued to maintain a high rate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of increase if there had been no immigration of
foreign laborers in the middle of the nineteenth
century and that the actual population of the United
States would be fully as large as it is now but
would have been almost exclusively native American
and Nordic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prosperity that followed the war attracted
hordes of newcomers who were welcomed by the
native Americans to operate factories, build railroads
and fill up the waste spaces—“developing
the country” it was called.</p>

<p class='c007'>These new immigrants were no longer exclusively
members of the Nordic race as were the earlier ones
who came of their own impulse to improve their
social conditions. The transportation lines advertised
America as a land flowing with milk and
honey and the European governments took the
opportunity to unload upon careless, wealthy and
hospitable America the sweepings of their jails and
asylums. The result was that the new immigration,
while it still included many strong elements
from the north of Europe, contained a large and
increasing number of the weak, the broken and the
mentally crippled of all races drawn from the lowest
stratum of the Mediterranean basin and the
Balkans, together with hordes of the wretched, submerged
populations of the Polish Ghettos. Our
jails, insane asylums and almshouses are filled with
this human flotsam and the whole tone of American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>life, social, moral and political has been
lowered and vulgarized by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a pathetic and fatuous belief in the efficacy
of American institutions and environment to reverse
or obliterate immemorial hereditary tendencies,
these newcomers were welcomed and given
a share in our land and prosperity. The American
taxed himself to sanitate and educate these
poor helots and as soon as they could speak
English, encouraged them to enter into the political
life, first of municipalities and then of the
nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The native Americans are splendid raw material,
but have as yet only an imperfectly developed
national consciousness. They lack the instinct
of self-preservation in a racial sense. Unless such
an instinct develops their race will perish, as do all
organisms which disregard this primary law of
nature. Nature had granted to the Americans
of a century ago the greatest opportunity in recorded
history to produce in the isolation of a continent
a powerful and racially homogeneous people
and had provided for the experiment a pure race
of one of the most gifted and vigorous stocks on
earth, a stock free from the diseases, physical and
moral, which have again and again sapped the
vigor of the older lands. Our grandfathers threw
away this opportunity in the blissful ignorance of
national childhood and inexperience.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The result of unlimited immigration is showing
plainly in the rapid decline in the birth rate of
native Americans because the poorer classes of
Colonial stock, where they still exist, will not bring
children into the world to compete in the labor market
with the Slovak, the Italian, the Syrian and the
Jew. The native American is too proud to mix
socially with them and is gradually withdrawing
from the scene, abandoning to these aliens the
land which he conquered and developed. The
man of the old stock is being crowded out of many
country districts by these foreigners just as he is
to-day being literally driven off the streets of New
York City by the swarms of Polish Jews. These
immigrants adopt the language of the native American,
they wear his clothes, they steal his name
and they are beginning to take his women, but they
seldom adopt his religion or understand his ideals
and while he is being elbowed out of his own home
the American looks calmly abroad and urges on
others the suicidal ethics which are exterminating
his own race.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the test of actual battle comes, it will, of
course, be the native American who will do the
fighting and suffer the losses. With him will
stand the immigrants of Nordic blood, but there
will be numbers of these foreigners in the large
cities who will prove to be physically unfit for military
duty.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>As to what the future mixture will be it is evident
that in large sections of the country the native
American will entirely disappear. He will not
intermarry with inferior races and he cannot compete
in the sweat shop and in the street trench with
the newcomers. Large cities from the days of
Rome, Alexandria, and Byzantium have always
been gathering points of diverse races, but New
York is becoming a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cloaca gentium</span></i> which will produce
many amazing racial hybrids and some ethnic
horrors that will be beyond the powers of future
anthropologists to unravel.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing is certain: in any such mixture, the
surviving traits will be determined by competition
between the lowest and most primitive elements
and the specialized traits of Nordic man; his
stature, his light colored eyes, his fair skin and
light colored hair, his straight nose and his splendid
fighting and moral qualities, will have little part in
the resultant mixture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “survival of the fittest” means the survival
of the type best adapted to existing conditions of
environment, which to-day are the tenement and
factory, as in Colonial times they were the clearing
of forests, fighting Indians, farming the fields
and sailing the Seven Seas. From the point of
view of race it were better described as the “survival
of the unfit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This review of the colonies of Europe would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>discouraging were it not for the fact that thus far
little attention has been paid to the suitability of
a new country for the particular colonists who
migrate there. The process of sending out colonists
is as old as mankind itself and probably in the last
analysis most of the chief races of the world, certainly
most of the inhabitants of Europe, represent
the descendants of successful colonists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Success in colonization depends on the selection
of new lands and climatic conditions in harmony
with the immemorial requirements of the incoming
race. The adjustment of each race to its own peculiar
habitat is based on thousands of years of rigid
selection which cannot be safely ignored. A certain
isolation and freedom from competition with
other races, for some centuries at least, is also important,
so that the colonists may become habituated
to their new surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Americans have not been on the continent
long enough to acquire this adjustment and consequently
do not present as effective a resistance
to competition with immigrants as did, let us say,
the Italians when overrun by northern barbarians.
As soon as a group of men migrate to new surroundings,
climatic, social or industrial, a new form of
selection arises and those not fitted to the new
conditions die off at a greater rate than in their
original home. This form of differential selection
plays a large part in modern industrial centres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and in large cities, where unsanitary conditions
bear more heavily on the children of Nordics than
on those of Alpines or Mediterraneans.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Before considering the living populations of
Europe we must give consideration to the extinct
peoples that preceded them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The science of anthropology is very recent—in
its present form less than fifty years old—but it has
already revolutionized our knowledge of the past
and extended prehistory so that it is now measured
not by thousands but by tens of thousands of
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of man prior to the period of metals
has been divided into ten or more subdivisions,
many of them longer than the time covered by
written records. Man has struggled up through
the ages, to revert again and again into savagery
and barbarism but apparently retaining each
time something gained by the travail of his ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>So long as there is in the world a freely breeding
stock or race that has in it an inherent capacity for
development and growth, mankind will continue
to ascend until, possibly through the selection and
regulation of breeding as intelligently applied as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>in the case of domestic animals, it will control its
own destiny and attain moral heights as yet unimagined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impulse upward, however, is supplied by a
very small number of nations and by a very small
proportion of the population in such nations. The
section of any community that produces leaders or
genius of any sort is only a minute percentage.
To utilize and adapt to human needs the forces and
the raw materials of nature, to invent new processes,
to establish new principles, and to elucidate
and unravel the laws that control the universe call
for genius. To imitate or to adopt what others
have invented is not genius but mimicry.</p>

<p class='c007'>This something which we call “genius” is not a
matter of family, but of stock or strain, and is inherited
in precisely the same manner as are the
purely physical characters. It may be latent
through several generations of obscurity and then
flare up when the opportunity comes. Of this we
have many examples in America. This is what
education or opportunity does for a community; it
permits in these rare cases fair play for development,
but it is race, always race, that produces
genius. An individual of inferior type or race
may profit greatly by good environment. On the
other hand, a member of a superior race in bad
surroundings may, and very often does, sink to an
extremely low level. While emphasizing the importance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of race, it must not be forgotten that
environment, while it does not alter the potential
capacity of the stock, can perform miracles in the
development of the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>This genius producing type is slow breeding and
there is real danger of its loss to mankind. Some
idea of the value of these small strains can be
gained from the recent statistics which demonstrate
that Massachusetts produces more than fifty times
as much genius per hundred thousand whites as does
Georgia, Alabama or Mississippi, although apparently
the race, religion and environment, other than
climatic conditions, are much the same, except for
the numbing presence in the South of a large stationary
Negro population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more thorough the study of European prehistory
becomes, the more we realize how many
advances of culture have been made and then lost.
Our parents were accustomed to regard the overthrow
of ancient civilization in the Dark Ages as
the greatest catastrophe of mankind, but we now
know that the classic period of Greece was preceded
by similar dark ages caused by the Dorian
invasions, that had overthrown the Homeric-Mycenæan
culture, which in its turn had flourished
after the destruction of its parent, the brilliant
Minoan culture of Crete. Still earlier, some twelve
thousand years ago, the Azilian Period of poverty
and retrogression succeeded the wonderful achievements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of the hunter-artists of the Upper Paleolithic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The progress of civilization becomes evident only
when immense periods are studied and compared,
but the lesson is always the same, namely, that
race is everything. Without race there can be
nothing except the slave wearing his master’s
clothes, stealing his master’s proud name, adopting
his master’s tongue and living in the crumbling
ruins of his master’s palace. Everywhere on the
sites of ancient civilizations the Turk, the Kurd
and the Bedouin camp; and Americans may well
pause and consider the fate of this country which
they, and they alone, founded and nourished with
their blood. The immigrant ditch diggers and the
railroad navvies were to our fathers what their
slaves were to the Romans and the same transfer
of political power from master to servant is taking
place to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man’s place of origin was undoubtedly Asia.
Europe is only a peninsula of the Eurasiatic continent
and although the extent of its land area
during the Pleistocene was much greater than
at present, it is certain from the distribution of
the various species of man, that the main races
evolved in Asia, probably north of the great Himalayan
range long before the centre of that continent
was reduced to a series of deserts by progressive
desiccation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The evidence based on man’s relatively large
bulk, on the lack of the development of his fore
limbs and particularly on his highly specialized
foot structure all indicate that he has not been
arboreal for a vast period of time, probably not
since the end of the Miocene. The change of
habitat from the trees to the ground may have been
caused by a profound modification of climate,
from moist to dry or from warm to cold, which
in turn may have affected the food supply and compelled
a more carnivorous diet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidence of the location of the early evolution
of man in Asia and in the geologically recent submerged
area toward the southeast is afforded by
the fossil deposits in the Siwalik hills of northern
India; where the remains of primates have been
found which were either ancestral or closely related
to the four genera of living anthropoids and
where we may confidently look for remains of
the earliest human forms; and by the discovery in
Java, which in Pliocene times was connected with
the mainland over what is now the South China
Sea, of the earliest known form of erect primate,
the <em>Pithecanthropus</em>. This ape-like man is practically
the “missing link,” being intermediate between
man and the anthropoids and is generally
believed to have been contemporary with the Günz
glaciation of some 500,000 years ago, the first of
the four great glacial advances in Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>One or two species of anthropoid apes have
been discovered in the Miocene of Europe which
may possibly have been remotely related to the
ancestors of man but when the archæological exploration
of Asia shall be as complete and intensive
as that of Europe it is probable that more
forms of fossil anthropoids and new species of man
will be found there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man existed in Europe during the second and
third interglacial periods, if not earlier. We have
his artifacts in the form of eoliths, at least as early
as the second interglacial stage, the Mindel-Riss,
of some 300,000 years ago. A single jaw found near
Heidelberg is referred to this period and is the
earliest skeletal evidence of man in Europe. From
certain remarkable characters in this jaw, it has been
assigned to a new species, <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then follows a long period showing only scanty
industrial relics and no known skeletal remains.
Man was slowly and painfully struggling up from a
culture phase where chance flints served his temporary
purpose. This period, known as the Eolithic,
was succeeded by a stage of human development
where slight chipping and retouching of flints
for his increasing needs led, after vast intervals of
time, to the deliberate manufacture of tools. This
Eolithic Period is necessarily extremely hazy and
uncertain. Whether or not certain chipped or
broken flints, called eoliths or dawn stones, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>actually human artifacts or were the products of
natural forces is, however, immaterial for man must
have passed through such an eolithic stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The further back we go toward the commencement
of this Eolithic culture, the more unrecognizable
the flints necessarily become until they finally
cannot be distinguished from natural stone fragments.
At the beginning, the earliest man merely
picked up a convenient stone, used it once and
flung it away, precisely as an anthropoid ape would
act to-day if he wanted to break the shell of a tortoise
or crack an ostrich egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man must have experienced the following phases
of development in the transition from the prehuman
to the human stage: first, the utilization of
chance stones and sticks; second, the casual adaptation
of flints by a minimum amount of chipping;
third, the deliberate manufacture of the simplest
implements from flint nodules; and fourth, the invention
of new forms of weapons and tools in ever
increasing variety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the last two stages we have an extensive and
clear record. Of the second stage we have in the
eoliths intermediate forms ranging from flints that
are evidently results of natural causes to flints that
are clearly artifacts. The first and earliest stage,
of course, could leave behind it no definite record
and must in the present state of our knowledge rest
on hypothesis.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>II<br /> <span class='large'>PALEOLITHIC MAN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With the deliberate manufacture of implements
from flint nodules, we enter the beginning of Paleolithic
time and from here on our way is relatively
clear. The successive stages of the Paleolithic were
of great length but are each characterized by some
improvement in the manufacture of tools. During
long ages man was merely a tool making and
tool using animal and, after all is said, that is
about as good a definition as we can find to-day
for the primate we call human.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Paleolithic Period or Old Stone Age lasted
from the somewhat indefinite termination of the
Eolithic, some 150,000 years ago, to the Neolithic
or New Stone Age, which began about 7000
B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Paleolithic falls naturally into three great
subdivisions. The Lower Paleolithic includes the
whole of the last interglacial stage with the subdivisions
of the Pre-Chellean, Chellean and Acheulean;
the Middle Paleolithic covers the whole of
the last glaciation and is co-extensive with the
Mousterian Period and the dominance of the Neanderthal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>species of man.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The Upper Paleolithic
embraces all the postglacial stages down to the
Neolithic and includes the subdivisions of the
Aurignacian, Solutrean, Magdalenian and Azilian.
During the entire Upper Paleolithic, except the short
closing phase, the Cro-Magnon race flourished.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The Middle Paleolithic Period is suggested here for the first time.—<span class='sc'>Editor’s
Note.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not until after the third severe period of
great cold, known as the Riss glaciation, nor until
we enter, some 150,000 years ago, the third and
last interglacial stage of temperate climate, known
as the Riss-Würm, that we find a definite and ascending
series of culture. The Pre-Chellean, Chellean
and Acheulean divisions of the Lower Paleolithic
occupied the whole of this warm or rather
temperate interglacial phase, which lasted nearly
100,000 years.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shattered skull, a jaw and some teeth have
been discovered recently in Sussex, England. These
remains were attributed to the same individual,
who was named the Piltdown Man. Owing to the
extraordinary thickness of the skull and the simian
character of the jaw, a new genus, <em>Eoanthropus</em>,
the “dawn man,” was created and assigned to
Pre-Chellean times. Some of the tentative restorations
of the fragmentary bones make this skull
altogether too modern and too capacious for a Pre-Chellean
or even a Chellean.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Further study and comparison with the jaws
of other primates also indicate that the jaw
belonged to a chimpanzee so that the genus
<em>Eoanthropus</em> must now be abandoned and the Piltdown
Man must be included in the genus <em>Homo</em>
as at present constituted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In any event the Piltdown Man is highly aberrant
and, so far as our present knowledge goes, does not
appear to be related to any other species of man
found during the Lower Paleolithic. Future discoveries
of the Piltdown type and for that matter
of Heidelberg Man may, however, raise either or
both of them to generic rank.</p>

<p class='c007'>In later Acheulean times a new human species,
very likely descended from the early Heidelberg
Man of Eolithic times, appears on the scene and is
known as the Neanderthal race. Many fossil remains
of this type have been found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neanderthaloids occupied the European
stage exclusively, with the possible exception of
the Piltdown Man, from the first appearance of
man in Europe to the end of the Middle Paleolithic.
The Neanderthals flourished throughout
the entire duration of the last glacial advance
known as the Würm glaciation. This period,
known as the Mousterian, began about 50,000
years ago and lasted some 25,000 years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neanderthal species disappears suddenly
and completely with the advent of postglacial times,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>when, about 25,000 years ago, it was apparently
supplanted or exterminated by a new and far
higher race, the famous Cro-Magnons.</p>

<p class='c007'>There may well have been during Mousterian
times races of man in Europe other than the Neanderthaloids,
but of them we have no record.
Among the numerous remains of Neanderthals,
however, we do find traces of distinct types showing
that this race in Europe was undergoing evolution
and was developing marked variations in
characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neanderthal Man was an almost purely meat
eating hunter, living in caves or rather in their entrances.
He was dolichocephalic and not unlike
existing Australoids, although not necessarily of
black skin and was, of course, in no sense a Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skull was characterized by heavy superorbital
ridges, a low and receding forehead, protruding
and chinless under jaw and the posture was imperfectly
erect. This race was widely spread and
rather numerous. Some of its blood may have
trickled down to the present time and occasionally
one sees a skull apparently of the Neanderthal
type. The best skull of this type ever seen by the
writer belonged to a very intellectual professor in
London, who was quite unconscious of his value as
a museum specimen. In the old black breed of
Scotland the overhanging brows and deep-set eyes
are suggestive of this race.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Along with other ancient and primitive racial
remnants, ferocious gorilla-like living specimens
of Paleolithic man are found not infrequently on
the west coast of Ireland and are easily recognized
by the great upper lip, bridgeless nose, beetling
brow with low growing hair and wild and
savage aspect. The proportions of the skull which
give rise to this large upper lip, the low forehead
and the superorbital ridges are certainly Neanderthal
characters. The other traits of this Irish type
are common to many primitive races. This is the
Irishman of caricature and the type was very frequent
in America when the first Irish immigrants
came in 1846 and the following years. It seems,
however, to have almost disappeared in this country.
If, as it is claimed, the Neanderthals have
left no trace of their blood in living populations,
these Firbolgs are derived from some very ancient
and primitive race as yet undescribed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Upper Paleolithic, which began after the
close of the fourth and last glaciation, about 25,000
years ago, the Neanderthal race was succeeded by
men of very modern aspect, known as Cro-Magnons.
The date of the beginning of the Upper
Paleolithic is the first we can fix with accuracy and
its correctness can be relied on within narrow limits.
The Cro-Magnon race first appears in the Aurignacian
subdivision of the Upper Paleolithic. Like the
Neanderthals, they were dolichocephalic but with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>a cranial capacity superior to the average in existing
European populations and a stature of very remarkable
size.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite astonishing to find that the predominant
race in Europe 25,000 years ago, or more,
was not only much taller, but had an absolute
cranial capacity in excess of the average of the
present population. The low cranial average of
existing populations in Europe can be best explained
by the presence of large numbers of individuals
of inferior mentality. These defectives
have been carefully preserved by modern charity,
whereas in the savage state of society the backward
members were allowed to perish and the race
was carried on by the vigorous and not by the
weaklings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The high brain capacity of the Cro-Magnons is
paralleled by that of the ancient Greeks, who in a
single century gave to the world out of their small
population much more genius than all the other
races of mankind have since succeeded in producing
in a similar length of time. Attica between
530 and 430 B. C. had an average population of
about 90,000 freemen, and yet from this number
were born no less than fourteen geniuses of the
very highest rank. This would indicate a general
intellectual status as much above that of the
Anglo-Saxons as the latter are above the Negroes.
The existence at these early dates of a very high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>cranial capacity and its later decline shows that
there is no upward tendency inherent in mankind
of sufficient strength to overcome obstacles placed
in its way by stupid social customs.</p>

<p class='c007'>All historians are familiar with the phenomenon
of a rise and decline in civilization such as has occurred
time and again in the history of the world
but we have here in the disappearance of the Cro-Magnon
race the earliest example of the replacement
of a very superior race by an inferior one.
There is great danger of a similar replacement of a
higher by a lower type here in America unless the
native American uses his superior intelligence to
protect himself and his children from competition
with intrusive peoples drained from the lowest
races of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the skull of the Cro-Magnon was long, the
cheek bones were very broad and this combination
of broad face with long skull constitutes a
peculiar disharmonic type which occurs to-day only
among the very highly specialized Esquimaux and
one or two other unimportant groups.</p>

<p class='c007'>Skulls of this particular type, however, are found
in small numbers among existing populations in
central France, precisely in the district where the
fossil remains of this race were first discovered.
These isolated Frenchmen probably represent the
last lingering remnant of this splendid race of hunting
savages.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The Cro-Magnon culture is found around the
basin of the Mediterranean, and this fact, together
with the conspicuous absence in eastern Europe of
its earliest phases, the lower Aurignacian, indicates
that it entered Europe by way of north Africa,
as its successors, the Mediterranean race, probably
did in Neolithic times. There is little doubt
that the Cro-Magnons originally developed in Asia
and were in their highest stage of physical development
at the time of their first appearance in
Europe. Whatever change took place in their
stature during their residence there seems to have
been in the nature of a decline rather than of a
further development.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing whatever of the Negroid in the
Cro-Magnons and they are not in any way related
to the Neanderthals, who represent a distinct and,
save for the suggestions made above, an extinct
species of man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cro-Magnon race persisted through the entire
Upper Paleolithic, during the periods known
as the Aurignacian, Solutrean and Magdalenian,
from 25,000 to 10,000 B. C. While it is possible
that the blood of this race enters somewhat into
the composition of the peoples of western Europe,
its influence cannot be great and the Cro-Magnons—the
Nordics of their day—disappear from
view with the advent of the warmer climate of
recent times.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>It has been suggested that, following the fading
ice edge north and eastward through Asia into
North America, they became the ancestors of the
Esquimaux but certain anatomical objections are
fatal to this interesting theory. No one, however,
who is familiar with the culture of the Esquimaux
and especially with their wonderful skill in bone
and ivory carving, can fail to be struck with the
similarity of their technique to that of the Cro-Magnons.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the Cro-Magnon race the world owes the birth
of art. Caverns and shelters are constantly unearthed
in France and Spain, where the walls and
ceilings are covered with polychrome paintings or
with incised bas-reliefs of animals of the chase. A
few clay models, sometimes of the human form,
are also found, together with abundant remains of
their chipped but unpolished stone weapons and
tools. Certain facts stand out clearly, namely,
that they were purely hunters and clothed themselves
in furs and skins. They knew nothing of
agriculture or of domestic animals, even the dog
being probably as yet untamed and the horse regarded
merely as an object of chase.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of their knowledge of the principle
of the bow and arrow during the Aurignacian and
Solutrean is an open one but there are definite indications
of the use of the arrow, or at least the
barbed dart, in early Magdalenian times and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>weapon was well known in the succeeding Azilian
Period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The presence toward the end of this last period
of quantities of very small flints called microliths
has given rise to much controversy. It is
possible that some of these microliths represent the
tips of small poisoned arrows such as are now in
very general use among primitive hunting tribes
the world over. Certain grooves in some of the
flint weapons of the Upper Paleolithic may also
have been used for the reception of poison. It is
highly probable that the immediate predecessors of
the Azilians, the Cro-Magnons, perhaps the greatest
hunters that ever lived, not only used poisoned
darts but were adepts in trapping game by means
of pitfalls and snares, precisely as do some of the
hunting tribes of Africa to-day. Barbed arrowheads
of flint or bone, such as were commonly used
by the North American Indians, have not been
found in Paleolithic deposits.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Solutrean Period the Cro-Magnons shared
Europe with a new race known as the Brünn-Předmost,
found in central Europe. This race
is characterized by a long face as well as a long
skull, and was, therefore, harmonic. This Brünn-Předmost
race appears to have been well settled
in the Danubian and Hungarian plains and this
location indicates an eastern rather than a southern
origin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Good anatomists have seen in this race the last
lingering traces of the Neanderthaloids but it is
more probable that we have here the first advance
wave of the primitive forerunners of one of the
modern European dolichocephalic races.</p>

<p class='c007'>This new race was not artistic, but had great
skill in fashioning weapons and possibly is associated
with the peculiarities of Solutrean culture and
the decline of art which characterizes that period.
The artistic impulse of the Cro-Magnons which
flourished so vigorously during the Aurignacian
seems to be quite suspended during this Solutrean
Period, but reappears in the succeeding Magdalenian
times. This Magdalenian art is clearly the
direct descendant of Aurignacian models and in
this closing age of the Cro-Magnons all forms of
Paleolithic art, carving, engraving, painting and
the manufacture of weapons, reach their highest
and final culmination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nine or ten thousand years may be assigned to
the Aurignacian and Solutrean Periods and we
may with considerable certainty give the minimum
date of 16,000 B. C. as the beginning of Magdalenian
time. Its entire duration can be safely set
down at 6,000 years, thus bringing the final termination
of the Magdalenian to 10,000 B. C. All
these dates are extremely conservative and the
error, if any, is in assigning too late and not too
early a period to the end of Magdalenian times.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>At the close of the Magdalenian we enter upon
the last period of Paleolithic times, the Azilian,
which lasted from about 10,000 to 7,000 B. C., when
the Upper Paleolithic, the age of chipped flints,
definitely and finally ends in Europe. This period
takes its name from the Mas d’Azil, or “House of
Refuge,” a huge cavern in the eastern Pyrenees
where the local Protestants took shelter during the
persecutions. The extensive deposits in this cave
are typical of the Azilian epoch and here certain
marked pebbles may be the earliest known traces
of symbolic writing, but true writing was probably
not developed until the late Neolithic.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the advent of this Azilian Period art entirely
disappears and the splendid physical type of
the Cro-Magnons is succeeded by what appear to
have been degraded savages, who had lost the
force and vigor necessary for the strenuous chase
of large game and had turned to the easier life of
fishermen.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Azilian the bow and arrow are in common
use in Spain and it is well within the possibilities
that the introduction and development of this new
weapon from the South may have played its part
in the destruction of the Cro-Magnons; otherwise
it is hard to account for the disappearance of this
race of large stature and great brain power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Azilian, also called the Tardenoisian in the
north of France, was evidently a period of racial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>disturbance and at its close the beginnings of the
existing races are found.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the first appearance of man in Europe
and for many tens of thousands of years down to
some ten or twelve thousand years ago all known
human remains are of dolichocephalic type.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Azilian Period appears the first round
skull race. It comes clearly from the East. Later
we shall find that this invasion of the forerunners
of the existing Alpine race came from southwestern
Asia by way of the Iranian plateau,
Asia Minor, the Balkans and the valley of the
Danube, and spread over nearly all of Europe.
The earlier round skull invasions may as well have
been infiltrations as armed conquests since apparently
from that day to this the round skulls
have occupied the poorer mountain districts and
have seldom ventured down to the rich and fertile
plains.</p>

<p class='c007'>This new brachycephalic race is known as the
Furfooz or Grenelle race, so called from the localities
in Belgium and France where it was first discovered.
Members of this round skull race have
also been found at Ofnet in Bavaria where they
occur in association with a dolichocephalic race,
our first historic evidence of the mixture of contrasted
races. The descendants of this Furfooz-Grenelle
race and of the succeeding waves of
invaders of the same brachycephalic type now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>occupy central Europe as Alpines and form the
predominant peasant type in central and eastern
Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this same Azilian Period there appear, coming
this time from the South, the first forerunners
of the Mediterranean race. The descendants of
this earliest wave of Mediterraneans and their later
reinforcements occupy all the coast and islands of
the Mediterranean and are spread widely over
western Europe. They can everywhere be identified
by their short stature, slight build, long skull
and brunet hair and eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>While during this Azilian-Tardenoisian Period
these ancestors of two of the existing European
races are appearing in central and southern Europe,
a new culture phase, also distinctly Pre-Neolithic,
was developing along the shores of the Baltic. It
is known as Maglemose from its type locality in
Denmark. It is believed to be the work of the
first wave of the Nordic race which had followed
the retreating glaciers northward over the old land
connections between Denmark and Sweden to occupy
the Scandinavian Peninsula. In the remains
of this culture we find definite evidence of the domesticated
dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the appearance of the Mediterranean race
the Azilian-Tardenoisian draws to its close and with
it the entire Paleolithic Period. It is safe to assign
for the end of the Paleolithic and the beginning of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the Neolithic or Polished Stone Age, the date of
7,000 or 8,000 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>The races of the Paleolithic Period, so far as we
can judge from their remains, appear successively
on the scene with all their characters fully developed.
The evolution of all these subspecies and
races took place somewhere in Asia or eastern
Europe. None of these races appear to be ancestral
one to another, although the scanty remains
of the Heidelberg Man would indicate that
he may have given rise to the later Neanderthals.
Other than this possible affinity, the various races
of Paleolithic times are not related one to another.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>III<br /> <span class='large'>THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>About 7,000 B.C. we enter an entirely new period
in the history of man, the Neolithic or New Stone
Age, when the flint implements were polished and
not merely chipped. Early as is this date in European
culture, we are not far from the beginnings
of an elaborate civilization in parts of Asia and
Egypt. The earliest organized governments, so far
as our present knowledge goes, were Egypt and
Sumer. Chinese civilization at the other end of
Asia is later, but mystery still shrouds its origin and
its connection, if any, with the Mesopotamian
city-states. The solution probably lies in the central
region of the Syr Darya and future excavations
in those regions may uncover very early cultures.
Balkh, the ancient Bactra, the mother of cities, is
located where the trade routes between China,
India and Mesopotamia converged and it is in this
neighborhood that careful and thorough excavations
will probably find their greatest reward.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, we are not dealing with Asia but with
Europe only and our knowledge is confined to the
fact that the various cultural advances at the end
of the Paleolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic
correspond with the arrival of new races.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic
was formerly considered as revolutionary,
an abrupt change of both race and culture, but
a period more or less transitory, known as the
Campignian, now appears to bridge over this gap.
This is only what should be expected, since in
human archæology as in geology the more detailed
our knowledge becomes the more gradually
we find one period or horizon merges into
its successor.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a long time after the opening of the Neolithic
the old-fashioned chipped weapons and implements
remain the predominant type and the
polished flints so characteristic of the Neolithic
appear at first only sporadically, then increase in
number until finally they entirely replace the
rougher designs of the preceding Old Stone Age.</p>

<p class='c007'>So in their turn these Neolithic polished stone
implements, which ultimately became both varied
and effective as weapons and tools, continued
in use long after metallurgy developed. In the
Bronze Period metal armor and weapons were
for ages of the greatest value. So they were necessarily
in the possession of the military and ruling
classes only, while the unfortunate serf or common
soldier who followed his master to war did
the best he could with leather shield and stone
weapons. In the ring that clustered around
Harold for the last stand on Senlac Hill many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of the English thanes died with their Saxon king,
armed solely with the stone battle-axes of their
ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Italy also there was a long period known to
the Italian archæologists as the Eneolithic Period
when good flint tools existed side by side with very
poor copper and bronze implements; so that, while
the Neolithic lasted in western Europe four or five
thousand years, it is, at its commencement, without
clear definition from the preceding Paleolithic
and at its end it merges gradually into the succeeding
ages of metals.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the opening Campignian phase there followed
a long period typical of the Neolithic, known
as the Robenhausian or Age of the Swiss Lake
Dwellers, which reached its height after 5000
B. C. The lake dwellings seem to have been the
work chiefly of the round skull Alpine races and
are found in numbers throughout the region of the
Alps and their foothills and along the valley of the
Danube.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Robenhausian pile built villages were the
earliest known form of fixed habitation in Europe
and the culture found in association with them
was a great advance over that of the preceding
Paleolithic. This type of permanent habitation
flourished through the entire Upper Neolithic and
the succeeding Bronze Age. Pile villages end in
Switzerland with the first appearance of iron but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>elsewhere, as on the upper Danube, they still existed
in the days of Herodotus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pottery is found together with domesticated animals
and agriculture, which appear during the Robenhausian
for the first time. The chase, supplemented
by trapping and fishing, was still common
but it probably was more for clothing than for food.
A permanent site is not alone the basis of an agricultural
community, but it also involves at least a
partial abandonment of the chase, because only
nomads can follow the game in its seasonal migrations
and hunted animals soon leave the neighborhood
of settlements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Terramara Period of northern Italy was a
later phase of culture contemporaneous with the
Upper Robenhausian and was typical of the Bronze
Age. During the Terramara Period fortified and
moated stations in swamps or close to the banks of
rivers became the favorite resorts instead of pile
villages built in lakes. The first traces of copper
are found during this period. The earliest human
remains in the Terramara deposits are long skulled,
but round skulls soon appear in association with
bronze implements. This indicates an original
population of Mediterranean affinities overwhelmed
later by Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Neolithic culture also flourished in the north of
Europe and particularly in Scandinavia now free
from ice. The coasts of the Baltic were apparently occupied for the first time at the very beginning
of this period, as no trace of Paleolithic industry
has been found there, other than the Maglemose,
which represents only the very latest phase of the
Old Stone Age. The kitchen middens, or refuse
heaps, of Sweden and more particularly of Denmark
date from the early Neolithic and thus are somewhat
earlier than the lake dwellers. Rough pottery
occurs in them for the first time, but no traces
of agriculture have been found and, as said, the dog
seems to have been the only domesticated animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these two centres, the Alps and the North,
an elaborate and variegated Neolithic culture spread
through western Europe and an autochthonous development
took place, comparatively little influenced
by trade intercourse with Asia after the first
immigrations of the new races.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may assume that the distribution of races in
Europe during the Neolithic was roughly as follows.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mediterranean basin and western Europe,
including Spain, Italy, Gaul, Britain and parts of
western Germany, were populated by Mediterranean
long heads. In Britain the Paleolithic population
must have been very small and the Neolithic
Mediterraneans were the first effectively to
open up the country. Even they kept to the open
moorlands and avoided the heavily wooded and
swampy valleys which to-day are the main centres
of population. Before metal and especially iron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>tools were in use forests were an almost complete
barrier to the expansion of an agricultural population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alps and the territories immediately adjacent,
with Central Gaul and much of the Balkans,
were inhabited by Alpine types. These Alpines
extended northward until they came in touch in
eastern Germany and Poland with the southernmost
Nordics, but as the Carpathians at a much
later date, namely, from the fourth to the eighth
century A. D., were the centre of radiation of the
Alpine Slavs, it is very possible that during the
Neolithic the early Nordics lay farther north and
east.</p>

<p class='c007'>North of the Alpines and occupying the shores
of the Baltic and Scandinavia, together with eastern
Germany, Poland and Russia, were located the
Nordics. At the very base of the Neolithic and
perhaps still earlier, this race occupied Scandinavia,
and Sweden became the nursery of what has been
generally called the Teutonic subdivision of the
Nordic race. It was in that country that the peculiar
characters of stature and blondness became
most accentuated and it is there that we find them
to-day in their greatest purity.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the Neolithic the remnants of early
Paleolithic man must have been numerous, but
later they were either exterminated or absorbed by
the existing European races.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>During all this Neolithic Period Mesopotamia
and Egypt were thousands of years in advance of
Europe, but only a small amount of culture from
these sources seems to have trickled westward up
the valley of the Danube, then and long afterward
the main route of intercourse between western
Asia and the heart of Europe. Some trade also
passed from the Black Sea up the Russian rivers
to the Baltic coasts. Along these latter routes there
came from the north to the Mediterranean world
the amber of the Baltic, a fossil resin greatly prized
by early man for its magic electrical qualities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gold was probably the first metal to attract the
attention of primitive man, but could only be used
for purposes of ornamentation. Copper, which is
often found in a pure state, was also one of the
earliest metals known and probably came first either
from the mines of Cyprus or of the Sinai Peninsula.
These latter mines are known to have been worked
before 3400 B. C. by systematic mining operations
and much earlier “the metal must have been obtained
by primitive methods from surface ore.” It
is, therefore, probable that copper was known and
used, at first for ornament and later for implements,
in Egypt before 4000 B. C. and possibly
even earlier in the Mesopotamian regions.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now reach the confines of recorded history
and the first absolutely fixed date, 4241 B. C., is
established for lower Egypt by the oldest known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>calendar. The earliest date as yet for Mesopotamia
is somewhat later, but these two countries supply
the basis of the chronology of the ancient world
until a few centuries before Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the use of copper the Neolithic fades to
its end and the Bronze Age commences soon thereafter.
This next step in advance was made apparently
before 3000 B. C. when some unknown genius
discovered that an amalgam of nine parts of copper
to one part of tin would produce the metal we now
call bronze, which has a texture and hardness suitable
for weapons and tools. The discovery revolutionized
the world. The new knowledge was a long
time spreading and weapons of this material were
of fabulous value, especially in countries where
there were no native mines and where spears and
swords could only be obtained through trade or
conquest. The esteem in which these bronze
weapons, and still more the later weapons of iron,
were held, is indicated by the innumerable legends
and myths concerning magic swords and armor,
the possession of which made the owner well-nigh
invulnerable and invincible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The necessity of obtaining tin for this amalgam
led to the early voyages of the Phœnicians, who
from the cities of Tyre and Sidon and their daughter
Carthage traversed the entire length of the
Mediterranean, founded colonies in Spain to work
the Spanish tin mines, passed the Pillars of Hercules
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>and finally voyaged through the stormy
Atlantic to the Cassiterides, the Tin Isles of Ultima
Thule. There, on the coasts of Cornwall, they
traded with the native British of kindred Mediterranean
race for the precious tin. These dangerous
and costly voyages become explicable only if the
value of this metal for the composition of bronze
be taken into consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>After these bronze weapons were elaborated in
Egypt the knowledge of their manufacture and
use was extended through conquest into Palestine,
and northward into Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of the possession of these new weapons
on the Alpine populations of western Asia was
magical and resulted in an intensive and final expansion
of round skulls into Europe. This invasion
came through Asia Minor, the Balkans and the
valley of the Danube, poured into Italy from the
north, introduced bronze among the earlier Alpine
lake dwellers of Switzerland and among the Mediterraneans
of the Terramara stations of the valley
of the Po and at a later date reached as far west
as Britain and as far north as Holland and Norway,
where its traces are still to be found among
the living population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The simultaneous appearance of bronze about
3000 or 2800 B. C. in the south as well as in the
north of Italy may possibly be attributed to a
lateral wave of this same invasion which, passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>through Egypt, where it left behind the so-called
Gizeh round skulls, reached Tunis and Sicily. In
southern Italy bronze may have been introduced
from Crete. With the first knowledge of metals begins
the Eneolithic Period of the Italians.</p>

<p class='c007'>The close resemblance in design and technique
among the implements of the Bronze Age in widely
separated localities is so great that we can infer
a relatively simultaneous introduction.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the introduction of bronze the custom of
incineration of the dead also appears and replaces
the typical Neolithic custom of inhumation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The introduction of bronze into England and
into Scandinavia may be safely dated about one
thousand years later, after 1800 B. C. The fact
that the Alpines only barely reached Ireland indicates
that at this time that island was severed
from England and that the land connection between
England and France had been broken. The
computation of the foregoing dates, of course, is
somewhat hypothetical, but the fixed fact remains
that this last expansion of the Alpines brought
the knowledge of bronze to western and northern
Europe and to the Mediterranean and Nordic peoples
living there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of the introduction of bronze in the
areas occupied chiefly by the Mediterranean race
along the Atlantic coast and in Britain, as well as
in north Africa from Tunis to Morocco, is seen
in the construction and in the wide distribution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the megalithic funeral monuments, which appear
to have been erected, not by Alpines but by the
dolichocephs. The occurrence of bronze tools and
weapons in the interments shows clearly that the
megaliths of the south of France date from the beginning
of the Bronze Age. The absence of bronze
from the dolmens of Brittany may indicate an earlier
age. It is, however, more likely that the opening
Bronze Age in the South was contemporary
with the late Neolithic in the North. The construction
and use of these monuments continued at least
until the very earliest trace of iron appears and in
fact mound burials among the Vikings were common
until the introduction of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although there is evidence of very early use of
iron in Egypt the knowledge of this metal as well
as of bronze in Europe centres around the area occupied
by the Alpines in the eastern Alps and its
earliest phase is known as the Hallstatt culture,
from a little town in the Tyrol where it was first
discovered. This Hallstatt iron culture appeared
about 1500 B. C. The Alpine Hittites in northeast
Asia Minor were probably the first to mine and
smelt iron and they introduced it to the Alpines of
eastern Europe, but it was the Nordics who benefited
by its use. Bronze weapons and the later iron
ones proved in the hands of these Northern barbarians
to be of terrible effectiveness. With these
metal swords in their grasp, the Nordics conquered
the Alpines of central Europe and then suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>entered the ancient world as raiders and destroyers
of cities. The classic civilizations of the northern
coasts of the Mediterranean Sea fell, one after another,
before the “Furor Normanorum,” just as
two thousand years later the provinces of Rome
were devastated by the last great flood of the Nordics
from beyond the Alps.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first Nordics to appear in European history
are tribes speaking Aryan tongues in the form of
the various Celtic and related dialects in the West,
of Umbrian in Italy and of Thracian in the Balkans.
These barbarians, pouring down from the
North, swept with them large numbers of Alpines
whom they had already thoroughly Nordicized.
The process of conquering and assimilating the Alpines
must have gone on for long centuries before
our first historic records and the work was so
thoroughly done that the very existence of this
Alpine race as a separate subspecies of man was
actually forgotten for many centuries by themselves
and by the world at large until it was revealed
in our own day by the science of skull measurements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hallstatt iron culture did not extend into
western Europe and the smelting and extensive
use of this metal in southern Britain and northwestern
Europe are of much later date and occur in
what is called the La Tène Period, usually assigned
to the fifth and fourth century B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Iron weapons were, however, known sporadically
in England much earlier, perhaps as far back as
800 B. C., but were very rare and were probably
importations from the Continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hallstatt relics have only been found in the
northeast or centre of France and it appears that
the Bronze Age continued in the remainder of that
country until about 700 B. C.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The spread of this La Tène culture is associated
with the Nordic Cymry, who constituted the last
wave of Celtic-speaking invaders into western Europe,
while the earlier Nordic Gauls and Goidels
had arrived in Gaul and Britain equipped with
bronze only.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Roman times, following the La Tène Period,
the main races of Europe occupied the relative
positions which they had held during the whole
Neolithic Period and which they hold to-day, with
the exception that the Nordic subspecies was less
extensively represented in western Europe than
when, a few hundred years later, the so-called Teutonic
tribes overran these countries; but on the
other hand, the Nordics occupied large areas in
eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland and Russia
now mainly occupied by the Slavs of Alpine race.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many countries in central Europe were in Roman
times inhabited by fair-haired, blue eyed barbarians,
where now the population is preponderantly brunet
and becoming yearly more so.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE ALPINE RACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Alpine race is clearly of Eastern and Asiatic
origin. It forms the westernmost extension of a
widespread subspecies which, outside of Europe,
occupies Asia Minor, Iran, the Pamirs and the
Hindu Kush. In fact the western Himalayas were
probably its original centre of evolution and radiation
and among its Asiatic members is a distinct
subdivision, the Armenoids.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpine race is distinguished by a round face
and correspondingly round skull which in the true
Armenians has a peculiar sugarloaf shape, a character
which can be easily recognized. The Alpines
must not be confounded with the slit-eyed Mongols
who centre around Thibet and the steppes of north
Asia. The fact that both these races are round
skulled does not involve identity of origin any more
than the long skulls of the Nordics and of the Mediterraneans
require that they be both considered of
the same subspecies, although good anthropologists
have been misled by this parallelism. The Alpines
are of stocky build and moderately short
stature, except sometimes where they have been
crossed with Nordic elements. This race is also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>characterized by dark hair, except where there has
been a strong Nordic admixture as in south Germany
and Switzerland. In Europe at the present
time the eye, also, is usually dark but sometimes
grayish. The ancestral Proto-Alpines from the
highlands of western Asia must, of course, have had
brunet eyes and very dark, probably black, hair.
Whether we are justified in considering gray eyes
as peculiar to populations of mixed Alpine and
Nordic blood is difficult to determine, but one
thing is certain, the combination of blue eyes and
flaxen hair is never Alpine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The European Alpines retain very little evidence
of their Asiatic origin except the skull shape and
have been in contact with the Nordic race so long
that in central and western Europe they are
everywhere saturated with the blood of that race.
Many populations now considered good Germans,
such as the majority of the Würtembergers, Bavarians,
Austrians, Swiss and Tyrolese are merely
Nordicized Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the Swiss are to-day neither tall nor long-headed, their country was thoroughly conquered
early in the Christian era by the Nordic Alemanni
who entered from the Rhine Valley. The exodus
of soldiers from the forest cantons throughout the
Middle Ages to fight as mercenaries in France and
Italy gradually drained off this Nordic element
until the chief evidence of its former existence lies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>to-day in the large amount of blondness among the
Swiss. With the loss of this type the nation has
ceased to be a military community.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first appearance in Europe of the Alpines
dates from the Azilian Period when it is represented
by the Furfooz-Grenelle race. There were later
several invasions of this race which entered Europe
from the Asia Minor plateaux, by way of the Balkans
and the valley of the Danube, during Neolithic
times and, also, at the beginning of the Bronze
Age. It appears also to have passed north of the
Black Sea, as some slight traces have been discovered
there of round skulls which long antedate
the existing population but the Russian brachycephaly
of to-day is of much later origin and is due
mainly to the eastward spread of Alpines from the
regions of the Carpathians since the first centuries
of our era.</p>

<p class='c007'>This race in its final expansion far to the northwest
ultimately reached Norway, Denmark and
Holland and planted among the dolichocephalic
natives small colonies of round skulls, which still
exist. These colonies are found along the coast
and while of small extent are clearly marked. On
the southwestern seaboard of Norway these round
heads are dark and relatively short.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this invasion reached the extreme northwest
of Europe its energy was spent and the
invaders were soon forced back into central Europe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>by the Nordics. The Alpines at this time of
maximum extension about 1800 B. C. crossed
into Britain and a few reached Ireland and introduced
bronze into both these islands. As the
metal appears about the same time in Sweden it
is safe to assume that it was introduced by this
invasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men of the Round Barrows in England
were Alpines, but their numbers were so scanty
that they have left behind them in the skulls of
the living population but little demonstrable evidence
of their former presence. If we are ever able
accurately to analyze the various strains that enter
in more or less minute quantities into the blood
of the British nation, we shall find many traces of
these Round Barrow men as well as other interesting
and ancient remnants especially in the western
isles and peninsulas.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the study of European populations the great
and fundamental fact about the British Isles is
the almost total absence there to-day of true Alpine
round skulls. It is the only important state in
Europe in which the round skulls play no part and
the only nation of any rank composed solely of
Nordic and Mediterranean races in approximately
equal numbers. To this fact are undoubtedly due
many of the individualities and much of the greatness
of the English people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cephalic index in England is rather low,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>about 78, but there is a type of tall men, with
a tendency to roundheadedness allied to a very
marked intellectual capacity, known as the “Beaker
Maker” type. They are probably descended from
the men of the Round Barrows, who while brachycephalic
were tall and presumably dark and
entered England on the east and northeast. The
Beaker Makers appear at the very end of the
Neolithic and, at least in the case of the last of
them to arrive, are identified with the Bronze
Age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before this tall, round-headed type reached Britain,
they had absorbed many Nordic elements
and they have nothing except the skull shape in
common with the Alpines living closest, those of
Belgium and France. However, they do suggest
strongly the Dinaric race of the Tyrol and Dalmatian
coast of the Adriatic. In addition to the
Beaker Makers remains of short, thick-set brachycephs
have also been found in small numbers.
These last appear to have been true Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The invasion of central Europe by Alpines,
which occurred in the Neolithic, following in the
wake of the Azilian forerunners of the same type—the
Furfooz-Grenelle race—represented a very
great advance in culture. They brought with
them from Asia the art of domesticating animals
and the first knowledge of the cereals and of pottery
and were an agricultural race in sharp contrast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to the flesh eating hunters who preceded
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Neolithic populations of the lake dwellings
in Switzerland and the extreme north of Italy, which
flourished about 5000 B. C., all belonged to this
Alpine race. A comparison of the scanty physical
remains of these lake dwellers with the inhabitants
of the existing villages on the lake shores demonstrates
that the skull shape has changed little or
not at all during the last seven thousand years
and affords us another proof of the persistency of
physical characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Alpine race in Europe is now so thoroughly
acclimated that it is no longer Asiatic in any respect
and has nothing in common with the Mongols
except its round skulls. Such Mongolian elements
as exist to-day in scattered groups throughout
eastern Europe are remnants of the later
invasions of Tatar hordes which, beginning with
Attila in the fifth century, ravaged eastern Europe
for hundreds of years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In western and central Europe the present distribution
of the Alpine race is a substantial recession
from its earlier extent and it has been everywhere
conquered and subordinated by Celtic- and
Teutonic-speaking Nordics. Beginning with the
first appearance of the Celtic-speaking Nordics in
western Europe, the Alpine race has been obliged
to give ground but has mingled its blood everywhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>with the conquerors and now after centuries
of obscurity it appears to be increasing again at the
expense of the master race.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpines reached Spain, as they reached
Britain, in small numbers and with spent force
but they still persist along the Cantabrian Alps as
well as among the French Basques on the northern
side of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Anaryan Basque or Euskarian language
may be a derivative of the original speech of these
Alpines, as its affinities point eastward and toward
Asia rather than southward and toward the littoral
of Africa and the Hamitic speech of the Mediterranean
Berbers. Basque was probably related to
the extinct Aquitanian. The Ligurian language,
also seemingly Anaryan, if ever closely deciphered
may throw some light on the subject. There are
dim traces all along the north African coast of a
round skull invasion about 3000 B. C. through
Syria, Egypt, Tripoli and Tunis and from there
through Sicily to southern Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpine race forms to-day, as in Cæsar’s
time, the great bulk of the population of central
France with a Nordic aristocracy resting upon it.
They occupy as the lower classes the uplands of
Belgium, where, known as Walloons, they speak an
archaic French dialect closely related to the ancient
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">langue d’oïl</span></i>. They form a majority of the
upland population of Alsace, Lorraine, Baden, Würtemberg,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Bavaria, Tyrol, Switzerland and northern
Italy; in short, of the entire central <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">massif</span></i> of Europe.
In Bavaria and the Tyrol the Alpines are
so thoroughly Nordicized that their true racial
affinities are betrayed by their round skulls alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we reach Austria we come in contact with
the Slavic-speaking nations which form a subdivision
of the Alpine race appearing relatively late
in history and radiating from the Carpathian
Mountains. In western and central Europe in
relation to the Nordic race the Alpine is everywhere
the ancient, underlying and submerged type.
The fertile lands, river valleys and cities are here in
the hands of the Nordics but in eastern Germany
and Poland we find conditions reversed. That is
an old Nordic broodland with a Nordic substratum
underlying the bulk of the peasantry, which now
consists of round skulled Alpine Slavs. On top of
these again we have an aristocratic upper class of
comparatively recent introduction and of Saxon
origin in eastern Germany. In Austria this upper
class is Swabian and Bavarian.</p>

<p class='c007'>The introduction of Slavs into eastern Germany
is believed to have been by infiltration and not
by conquest. In the fourth century these Wends
were called Venethi, Antes and Sclaveni, and were
described as strong in numbers but despised in war.
Through the neglect of the Teutons they had been
allowed to range far and wide from their homes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>near the northeastern Carpathians and to occupy
the lands formerly belonging to the Nordic nations,
who had abandoned their country and flocked into
the Roman Empire. Goth, Burgund, Lombard
and Vandal were replaced by the lowly Wend and
Sorb, whose descendants to-day form the privates
in the east German regiments, while the officers are
everywhere recruited from the Nordic upper class.
The mediæval relation of these Slavic tribes to the
dominant Teuton is well expressed in the meaning—slave—which
has been attached to their name
in western languages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The occupation of eastern Germany and Poland
by the Slavs probably occurred from 400 A. D. to
700 A. D. but these Alpine elements were reinforced
from the east and south from time to time
during the succeeding centuries. Beginning early
in the tenth century, the Saxons under their Emperors,
especially Henry the Fowler, turned their
attention eastward and during the next two centuries
they reconquered and thoroughly Germanized
all this section of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar series of changes in racial predominance
took place in Russia where in addition to a nobility
largely Nordic a section of the population is of
ancient Nordic type, although the bulk of the peasantry
consists of Alpine Slavs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpines in eastern Europe are represented
by various branches of the “Slavic” nations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Their area of distribution was split into two sections
by the occupation of the great Dacian plain first
by the Avars about 600 A. D. and later by the
Hungarians about 900 A. D. These Avars and
Magyars came from somewhere in eastern Russia
beyond the sphere of Aryan speech and their
invasions separated the northern Slavs, known as
Wends, Czechs, Slovaks, and Poles, from the
southern Slavs, known as Serbs and Croats. These
southern Slavs entered the Balkan Peninsula in the
sixth century from the northeast and to-day form
the great mass of the population there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The centre of radiation of all these Slavic-speaking
Alpines was located in the Carpathians, especially
the Ruthenian districts of Galicia and eastward
to the neighborhood of the Pripet swamps
and the head-waters of the Dnieper in Polesia,
where the Slavic dialects are believed to have
developed and whence they spread throughout
Russia about the eighth century. These early
Slavs were probably the Sarmatians of the Greek
and Roman writers. Their name “Venethi” seems
to have been a later designation. The original
Proto-Slavic language being Aryan must have been
at some distant date imposed by Nordics upon the
Alpines, but its development into the present Slavic
tongues was chiefly the work of Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, the expansion of the Alpines of
the Slavic-speaking group seems to have occurred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>after the Fourth Century and they have spread
in the East over areas which were originally Nordic,
very much as the Teutons had previously
overrun and submerged the earlier Alpines in the
West. The Mongol, Tatar and Turk who invaded
Europe much later reinforced the brachycephalic
element in these countries. To some extent the
round skulled Alpines in Russia have been reinforced
by way of the Caucasus and the route
north of the Black Sea by their kindred in western
Asia. The greater part of the purely Asiatic types
has been thoroughly absorbed and Europeanized
except in certain localities in Russia more especially
in the east and south, where Mongoloid tribes
such as the Mordvins, Bashkirs and Kalmucks
have maintained their type either in isolated
and relatively large groups or side by side with
their Slavic neighbors. In both cases the isolation
is maintained through religious and social
differences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Avars preceded the Magyars in Hungary,
but they have merged with the latter without
leaving traces that can be identified. Certain
Mongoloid characters found in Bulgaria are believed,
however, to be of Avar origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The original physical type of the Magyars and
the European Turks has now practically vanished
as a result of prolonged intermarriage with the
original inhabitants of Hungary and the Balkans.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>These tribes have left little behind but their language
and, in the case of the Turks, their religion.
The brachycephalic Hungarians to-day resemble
the Austrian Germans much more than they do the
Slavic-speaking populations adjoining them on the
north and south or the Rumanians on the east.</p>

<p class='c007'>Driven onward by the Avars, the Bulgars appeared
south of the Danube about the end of the
seventh century, coming originally from eastern
Russia where the remnants of their kindred still
persist along the Volga. To-day they conform
physically in the western half of the country to
the Alpine Serbs and in the eastern half to the
Mediterranean race, as do also the Rumanians of
the Black Sea coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little or nothing remains of the ancestral Bulgars
except their name. Language, religion and
nearly, but not quite all, of the physical type have
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early members of the Nordic race in order
to reach the Mediterranean world had to pass
through the Alpine populations and must have
absorbed a certain amount of Alpine blood. Therefore
the Umbrians in Italy and the Gauls of western
Europe, while predominantly Nordic, were
more mixed especially in the lower classes with
Alpine blood than were the Belgæ or Cymry or
their successors, the Goths, Vandals, Burgundians,
Alemanni, Saxons, Franks, Lombards, Danes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Northmen, all of whom appear in history as Nordics
of the so-called Teutonic group.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some portions of their range notably Savoy
and central France the Alpine race is much less
affected by Nordic influence than elsewhere but on
the contrary it shows signs of a very ancient admixture
with Mediterranean and even earlier elements.
Brachycephalic Alpine populations in comparative
purity still exist in the interior of Brittany
as in Auvergne, although nearly surrounded by
Nordic populations.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the Alpines were everywhere overwhelmed
and driven to the fastnesses of the mountains, the
warlike and restless nature of the Nordics has enabled
the more stable Alpine population to reassert
itself slowly, and Europe is probably much less
Nordic to-day than it was fifteen hundred years
ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early Alpines made very large contributions
to the civilization of the world and were the
medium through which many advances in culture
were introduced from Asia into Europe. This
race at the time of its first appearance in the west
brought to the nomad hunters a knowledge of agriculture
and of primitive pottery and of domestication
of animals and thus made possible a great
increase in population and the establishment of
permanent settlements. Still later its final expansion
was the means through which the knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of metals reached the Mediterranean and Nordic
populations of the west and north. Upon the appearance
on the scene of the Nordics the Alpine
race temporarily lost its identity and sank to the
subordinate and obscure position which it still
largely occupies.</p>

<p class='c007'>In western Asia members of this race seemingly
are entitled to the honor of the earliest Mesopotamian
civilization of which we have knowledge,
namely, that of Sumer and its northerly neighbor
Accad in Mesopotamia. It is also the race of early
Elam and Media. In fact, the basis of Mesopotamian
civilization belongs to this race. Later
Babylonia and Assyria were Arabic and Semitic
while Persia was Nordic and Aryan.</p>

<p class='c007'>In classic, mediæval and modern times the Alpines
have played an unimportant part in European
culture and in western Europe they have
been so thoroughly Nordicized that they exist
rather as an element in Nordic race development
than as an independent type. There are, however,
many indications in current history which point to
an impending development of civilization in the
Slavic branches of this race and the world must
be prepared to face changes in the Russias which
will, for good or for evil, bring them more closely
into touch with western Europe.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>V<br /> <span class='large'>THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Mediterranean subspecies formerly called
the Iberian is a relatively small, light boned, long
skulled race, of brunet coloring, becoming even
swarthy in certain portions of its range. Throughout
Neolithic times and possibly still earlier it
seems to have occupied, as it does to-day, all the
shores of the Mediterranean including the coast
of Africa from Morocco on the west to Egypt on
the east. The Mediterraneans are the western
members of a subspecies of man which forms a
substantial part of the population of Persia, Afghanistan,
Baluchistan and Hindustan with perhaps a
southward extension into Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Aryanized Afghan and Hindu of northern
India speak languages derived from Old Sanskrit
and are distantly related to the Mediterranean race.
Aside from a common dolichocephaly these peoples
are entirely distinct from the Dravidians of south
India whose speech is agglutinative and who show
strong evidence of profound mixture with the ancient
Negrito substratum of southern Asia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everywhere throughout the Asiatic portion of
its range the Mediterranean race overlies an even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>more ancient Negroid race. These Negroids still
have representatives among the Pre-Dravidians of
India, the Veddahs of Ceylon, the Sakai of the
Malay Peninsula and the natives of the Andaman
Islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Mediterranean subspecies at the close of
the Paleolithic spread from the basin of the Inland
Sea northward by way of Spain throughout westernmost
Europe including the British Isles and,
before the final expansion of the Alpines, was widely
distributed up to and, possibly, touching the domain
of the Nordic dolichocephs. The Mediterraneans
did not cross the Alps from the south but spread
around the mountains. In attaining to Britain
from Spain by way of Central France it is probable
that they swept with them Paleolithic remnants
from the ancient centre of population in the Auvergne
district.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all this vast range from the British Isles to
Hindustan, it is not to be supposed that there is
absolute identity of race. Certain portions, however,
of the populations of the countries throughout
this long stretch do show in their physique
clear indications of descent from a Neolithic race
of a common original type, which we may call
Proto-Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite apart from inevitable admixture with late
Nordic and early Paleolithic elements, the brunet
type of Englishman has had perhaps ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>thousand years of independent evolution during
which he has undergone selection due to the climatic
and physical conditions of his northern habitat.
The result is that he has specialized far away
from the Proto-Mediterranean race which contributed
his blood originally to Britain while it was,
probably, still part of continental Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the other end of their range in India this
race, the Mediterraneans, have been crossed with
Dravidians and with Pre-Dravidian Negroids.
They have also had imposed upon them other
ethnic elements which came over through the Afghan
passes from the northwest. The resultant
racial mixture in India has had its own line of
specialization. Residence in the fertile but unhealthy
river bottoms, the direct rays of a tropic
sun and competition with the immemorial autochthones
have unsparingly weeded generation after
generation until the existing Hindu has little in
common with the ancestral Proto-Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to the Mediterranean race in the British
Isles that the English, Scotch and Americans
owe whatever brunet characters they possess. In
western Europe, wherever it exists, it appears to
underlie the Alpine race and, in fact, wherever this
race is in contact with either the Alpines or the
Nordics it would seem to represent the more ancient
stratum of the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as we know this Mediterranean type never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>existed in Scandinavia and all brunet elements
found there can be attributed to introductions in
the Bronze Age or in historic times. Nor did the
Mediterranean race ever enter or cross the high
Alps as did the Nordics at a much later date on
their way to the Mediterranean basin from the
Baltic coasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mediterranean race with its Asiatic extensions
is bordered everywhere on the north of its
enormous range from Spain to India by round
skulls but there does not seem to be as much evidence
of mixture between these two subspecies of
man as there is between the Alpines and the Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Along its southern boundary the Mediterraneans
are in contact with either the long skulled Negroes
of Africa or the ancient Negrito population of
southern Asia. In Africa this race has drifted
southward over the Sahara and up the Nile Valley
and has modified the blood of the Negroes in both
the Senegambian and equatorial regions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beyond these mixtures of blood, there is absolutely
no relationship between the Mediterranean
race and the Negroes. The fact that the Mediterranean
race is long skulled as well as the Negro
does not indicate relationship as has been suggested.
An overemphasis of the importance of the skull
shape as a somatological character can easily
mislead and characters other than skull proportions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>must be carefully considered in determining
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a zoological point of view Africa north of
the Sahara is now and has been since early Tertiary
times a part of Europe. This is true both of
animals and of the races of man. The Berbers of
north Africa to-day are racially identical with the
Spaniards and south Italians while the ancient
Egyptians and their modern descendants, the fellaheen,
are merely well-marked varieties of this
Mediterranean race.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Egyptians fade off toward the west into
the so-called Hamitic peoples (to use an obsolete
name) of Libya, and toward the south the infusion
of Negro blood becomes increasingly great until
we finally reach the pure Negro. On the east in
Arabia we find an ancient and highly specialized
subdivision of the Mediterranean race, which has
from time out of mind crossed the Red Sea and
infused its blood into the Negroes of east Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>To-day the Mediterranean race forms in Europe
a substantial part of the population of the British
Isles, the great bulk of the population of the Iberian
Peninsula, nearly one-third of the population
of France, Liguria, Italy south of the Apennines
and all the Mediterranean coasts and islands, in
some of which like Sardinia it exists in great purity.
It forms the substratum of the population of
Greece and of the eastern coast of the Balkan Peninsula.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Everywhere in the interior of the Balkan
Peninsula, except in eastern Bulgaria and parts of
Rumania, it has been replaced by the South Slavs
and by the Albanians, the latter a mixture of the
ancient Illyrians and the Slavs.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the British Isles the Mediterranean race represents
the Pre-Nordic population and exists in
considerable numbers in Wales and in certain portions
of England, notably in the Fen districts to
the northeast of London. In Scotland it is far less
marked, but has left its brunetness as an indication
of its former prevalence and this dark hair and eye
color is very often associated with tall stature.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the race that gave the world the great
civilizations of Egypt, of Crete, of Phœnicia including
Carthage, of Etruria, of Mycenæan Greece,
of Assyria and much of Babylonia. It gave us,
when mixed and invigorated with Nordic elements,
which probably predominated in the upper and
ruling classes and imposed their guidance upon the
masses, the most splendid of all civilizations, that
of ancient Hellas, and the most enduring of political
organizations, the Roman state.</p>

<p class='c007'>To what extent the Mediterranean race entered
into the blood and civilization of Rome, it is now
difficult to say, but the traditions of the Eternal
City, its love of organization, of law and military
efficiency, as well as the Roman ideals of family
life, of loyalty and truth, point clearly to a northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>rather than to a Mediterranean origin, although
there must have been some Alpine strains mixed in
with the Nordic element.</p>

<p class='c007'>The struggles in early Rome between Latin and
Etruscan and the endless quarrels between patrician
and plebeian may have arisen from this existence
in Rome, side by side, of two distinct and
clashing races, probably Nordic and Mediterranean
respectively. The Roman busts that have come
down to us often show features of a very Anglo-Saxon
cast but with a somewhat round head. The
Romans were short in stature in comparison with
the nations north of the Alps and in the recently
discovered battlefield of the Teutoburgian Forest
where Varus and his legions perished in the reign
of Augustus the skeletons of the Romans, identified
by their armor, were notably smaller and slighter
than were those of the German victors. The indications
on the whole point to a Nordic aristocracy
in Rome with some Alpine elements. The Plebs,
on the other hand, was largely Mediterranean and
Oriental and finally in the last days of the Republic
ceased to contain any purely Roman blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The northern qualities of Rome are in sharp
contrast to the less European traits of the classic
Greeks, whose volatile and analytical spirit, lack
of cohesion, political incapacity and ready resort to
treason all point clearly to southern and eastern
affinities.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>While very ancient, located for probably ten
thousand years in western and southern Europe, and
even longer on the south shore of the Mediterranean,
nevertheless this subspecies cannot be called purely
European. Its occupation of the north coast of
Africa and the west coast of Europe can be traced
everywhere by its beautifully polished stone
weapons and tools. The megalithic monuments
also, which are found in association with this race,
may mark its line of advance in western Europe,
although they extend beyond the range of the
Mediterraneans into the domain of the Scandinavian
Nordics. These huge stone structures were
chiefly sepulchral memorials and are very suggestive
of the Egyptian funeral monuments. They
date back to the first knowledge of the manufacture
and use of bronze tools by the Mediterranean
race. They occur in great numbers, size and variety
along the north coast of Africa and up the
Atlantic seaboard through Spain, Brittany and
England to Scandinavia.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is admitted that the various groups of the
Mediterranean race did not speak in the first instance
any form of Aryan tongue and we know
that these languages were introduced into the Mediterranean
world by invaders from the north.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Spain the language of the Nordic invaders
was Celtic and is believed to have nearly died out
by Roman times. Its remnants and the ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>speech of the natives were in turn superseded,
along with the Phœnician spoken in some of the
southern coast towns, by the Latin of the conquering
Roman. Latin mixed with some small
elements of Gothic construction and Arabic vocabulary
forms to-day the basis of modern Portuguese,
Castilian and Catalan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The native Mediterranean race of the Iberian
Peninsula quickly absorbed the blood of these
Celtic-speaking Nordic Gauls, just as it later
diluted beyond recognition the vigorous physical
characters of the Nordic Vandals, Suevi and Visigoths.
A certain amount of Nordic blood still
persists to-day in northern Spain, especially in
Galicia and along the Pyrenees, as well as generally
among the upper classes. According to
classic writers there were light and dark types in
Spain in Roman times. The Romans left no evidence
of their domination except in their language
and religion; while the earlier Phœnicians on the
coasts and the later swarms of Moors and Arabs
all over the peninsula, but chiefly in the south,
were closely related by race to the native Iberians.</p>

<p class='c007'>That portion of the Mediterranean race which
inhabits southern France occupies most of the
territory of ancient Languedoc and Provence and
it was these Provençals who developed and preserved
during the Middle Ages the romantic civilization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of the Albigensians, a survival of classic culture
which was drowned in blood by a crusade from
the north in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'>In northern Italy only the coast of Liguria is
occupied by the Mediterranean race. In the valley
of the Po the Mediterraneans predominated
during the early Neolithic but with the introduction
of bronze the Alpines appear and round
skulls to this day prevail north of the Apennines.
About 1100 B. C. the Nordic Umbrians and Oscans
swept over the Alps from the northeast, conquered
northern Italy and introduced their Aryan speech,
which gradually spread southward. The Umbrian
state was afterward overwhelmed by the Tyrrhenians
or Etruscans, who were of Mediterranean
race and who, by 800 B. C. had extended their
empire northward to the Alps and temporarily
checked the advance of the Nordics. In the sixth
century B. C. new swarms of Nordics, coming this
time from Gaul and speaking Celtic dialects, seized
the valley of the Po and in 382 B. C. these Gauls,
heavily reinforced from the north and under the
leadership of Brennus, stormed Rome and completely
destroyed the Etruscan power. From that
time onward the valley of the Po became known as
Cisalpine Gaul. Mixed with other Nordic elements,
chiefly Gothic and Lombard, this population persists
to this day, and is the backbone of modern
Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>A continuation of this movement of these Gauls,
or Galatians as the Greek world called them, starting
from northern Italy occurred a century later
when these Nordics suddenly appeared before Delphi
in Greece in 279 B. C. and then crossed into
Asia Minor and founded the state called Galatia,
which endured until Christian times.</p>

<p class='c007'>South Italy until its conquest by Rome was
Magna Græcia and the population to-day retains
many Pelasgian Greek elements. It is among these
classic remnants that artists search for the handsomest
specimens of the Mediterranean race. In
Sicily also the race is purely Mediterranean in spite
of the admixture of types coming from the neighboring
coasts of Tunis. These intrusive elements,
however, were all of kindred race. Traces of Alpines
in these regions and on the adjoining African
coast are very scarce and wherever found may be
referred to the final wave of round skull invasion
which introduced bronze into Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Greece the Mediterranean Pelasgians speaking
a Non-Aryan tongue were conquered by the Nordic
Achæans, who entered from the northeast according
to tradition prior to 1250 B. C. probably between
1400 and 1300 B. C. Doubtless there were
still earlier waves of these same Nordic invaders
as far back as 1700 B. C., which was a period of
general unrest and migration throughout the ancient
world.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>The Nordic Achæans and Mediterranean Pelasgians
as yet unmixed stand out in clear contrast in
the Homeric account of the ten year siege of Troy,
which is generally assigned to the date of 1194 to
1184 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same invasion that brought the Achæans
into Greece brought a related Nordic people to
the coast of Asia Minor, known as Phrygians. Of
this race were the Trojan leaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both the Trojans and the Greeks were commanded
by huge blond princes, the heroes of Homer—in
fact, even the Gods were fair-haired—while
the bulk of the armies on both sides was composed
of little brunet Pelasgians, imperfectly armed
and remorselessly butchered by the leaders on
either side. The only common soldiers mentioned
by Homer as of the same race as the heroes were
the Myrmidons of Achilles.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the time that the Achæans and the Pelasgians
began to amalgamate, new hordes of Nordic
barbarians collectively called Hellenes entered
from the northern mountains and destroyed this
old Homeric-Mycenæan civilization. This Dorian
invasion took place a little before 1100 B. C. and
brought in the three main Nordic strains of Greece,
the Dorian, the Æolian and the Ionian groups,
which remain more or less distinct and separate
throughout Greek history. Among these Nordics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the Dorians may have included some Alpine elements.
It is more than probable that this invasion
or swarming of Nordics into Greece was part of
the same general racial upheaval that brought
the Umbrians and Oscans into Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long years of intense and bitter conflict follow
between the old population and the newcomers
and when the turmoil of this revolution settled
down classic Greece appears. What was left of
the Achæans retired to the northern Peloponnesus
and the survivors of the early Pelasgian population
remained in Messenia serving as helots their
Spartan masters. The Greek colonies in Asia
Minor were founded largely by refugees fleeing
from these Dorian invaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pelasgian strain seems to have persisted
best in Attica and the Ionian states. The Dorian
Spartans appear to have retained more of the character
of the northern barbarians than the Ionian
Greeks but the splendid civilization of Hellas was
due to a fusion of the two elements, the Achæan
and Hellene of Nordic and the Pelasgian of Mediterranean
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrast between Dorian Sparta and Ionian
Athens, between the military efficiency, thorough
organization and sacrifice of the citizen for the
welfare of the state, which constituted the basis
of Lacedæmonian power, and the Attic brilliancy,
instability and extreme development of individualism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>is strikingly like the contrast between Prussia
with its Spartan-like culture and France with its
Athenian versatility.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this mixture of races in classic Greece the
Mediterranean Pelasgians contributed their Mycenæan
culture and the Nordic Achæans and Hellenes
contributed their Aryan language, fighting
efficiency and the European aspect of Greek life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first result of a crossing of two such contrasted
subspecies as the Nordic and Mediterranean
races has repeatedly been a new outburst of
civilization. This occurs as soon as the older race
has imparted to the conquerors its culture and before
the victors have allowed their blood to be attenuated
by mixture. This process seems to have
happened several times in Greece.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, in 338 B. C., when the original Nordic
blood had been hopelessly diluted by mixture with
the ancient Mediterranean elements, Hellas fell
an easy prey to Macedon. The troops of Philip
and Alexander were Nordic and represented the
uncultured but unmixed ancestral type of the
Achæans and Hellenes. Their unimpaired fighting
strength was irresistible as soon as it was organized
into the Macedonian phalanx, whether directed
against their degenerate brother Greeks or against
the Persians, whose original Nordic elements had
also by this time practically disappeared. When
in its turn the pure Macedonian blood was impaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>by intermixture with Asiatics, they, too,
vanished and even the royal Macedonian dynasties
in Asia and Egypt soon ceased to be Nordic
or Greek except in language and customs.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to note that the Greek states
in which the Nordic element most predominated
outlived the other states. Athens fell before Sparta
and Thebes outlived them both. Macedon in
classic times was considered quite the most barbarous
state in Hellas and was scarcely recognized
as forming part of Greece, but it was through the
military power of its armies and the genius of Alexander
that the Levant and western Asia became
Hellenized. Alexander with his Nordic features,
aquiline nose, fair skin, gently curling light hair
and mixed eyes, the left blue and the right very
black, typifies this Nordic conquest of the Near
East.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is scarcely possible to-day to find in purity the
physical traits of the ancient race in the Greek-speaking
lands and islands and it is chiefly among
the pure Nordics of Anglo-Norman type that there
occur those smooth and regular classic features,
especially the brow and nose lines, that were the
delight of the sculptors of Hellas.</p>

<p class='c007'>To what extent any of the blood of the ancient
Hellenes flows in the veins of the Greeks of to-day
is difficult to determine but it should be found,
if anywhere, in Crete and in the Ægean Islands.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>The modern Greek is trying to purify his language
back to classic Ionian and to appropriate the
traditions of the mighty Past, but to do this something
more is needed than the naming of children
after Agamemnon and Hecuba. Even in Roman
times, the ancient Greek of the classic period was
little more than a tradition and the term Græculus
given to the contemporary Hellenes was one of
contempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning the physical type of classic in contrast
to Homeric Greece, we know that the Greeks
were predominantly long-headed and of relatively
short stature in comparison with the northern barbarians.
The modern Greeks are also relatively
short in stature, but are moderately round-headed.
As to color these modern Greeks are substantially all
dark as to eye and hair, with a somewhat swarthy
skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among Albanians and such Greeks as show blond
traits light eyes are more than ten times as numerous
as light hair. The Albanians are members of
the tall, round-headed Dinaric race and have distant
relationship with the Nordics. They may possibly
represent an ancient cross between Nordics and Alpines
and they constitute to-day a marked subdivision
of the latter. They resemble the Round Barrow
brachycephs who entered Britain just before
or at the opening of the Bronze Age and who are
still scantily represented among the living English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and Welsh. This type called the Beaker Maker or
Borreby type is characterized by a moderately
round head and great stature, strength and considerable
intellectual force. The Albanian or Dinaric
type was not, so far as we know, represented
in ancient Greece although some modern archæologists
have suggested that the Spartans were of
this type. We have as yet no evidence of the color,
size and skull shape of the Spartans, but we do
know that their Dorian ancestors claimed to have
come from or through the mountains of northern
Epirus (Albania). The Dorian dialects are also
said to be more closely related to modern Albanian—which
is derived from the ancient Illyrian—than
are the Ionian dialects. The Spartan character, if
that be any test of race, was heavy, slow and
steady, and would indicate northern rather than
Mediterranean antecedents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning modern Europe north of the Alps,
culture came from the south and not from the east
and to the Mediterranean subspecies is due the
foundation of our civilization. The ancient Mediterranean
world was for the most part of this race;
the long-sustained civilization of Egypt, which endured
for thousands of years in almost uninterrupted
sequence; the brilliant Minoan Empire of
Crete, which flourished between 3000 and 1200
B. C. and was the ancestor of the Mycenæan cultures
of Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Sardinia; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>mysterious Empire of Etruria, the predecessor and
teacher of Rome; the Hellenic states and colonies
throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas; the
maritime and mercantile power of Phœnicia and
its mighty colony, imperial Carthage; all were the
creation of this race. The sea empire of Crete,
when its royal palace at Cnossos was burned by the
‘sea peoples’ of the north, passed to Tyre, Sidon
and Carthage and from them to the Greeks. The
early development of the art of navigation is
to be attributed to this race and from them the
North centuries later learned its maritime architecture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even though the Mediterranean race has no
claim to the invention of the synthetic languages
and though it played a relatively small part in the
development of the civilization of the Middle
Ages or of modern times, nevertheless to it belongs
the chief credit of the classic civilization of Europe
in the sciences, art, poetry, literature and philosophy,
as well as the major part of the civilization of
Greece and a very large share in the Empire of
Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Eastern Empire the Mediterraneans were
the predominant factor under the guise of Byzantine
Greeks. Owing to the fact that our histories
have been written under the influence of Roman
orthodoxy and because in the eyes of the Frankish
Crusaders the Byzantine Greeks were heretics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>they have been regarded by us as degenerate cowards.</p>

<p class='c007'>But throughout the Middle Ages Byzantium
represented in unbroken sequence the Empire of
Rome in the East and as the capital of that Empire
it held Mohammedan Asia in check for nearly
a thousand years. When at last in 1453 the imperial
city deserted by western Christendom was
stormed by the Ottoman Turks and Constantine,
last of Roman Emperors, fell sword in hand there
was enacted one of the greatest tragedies of all
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the fall of Constantinople the Empire of
Rome passes finally from the scene of history and
the development of civilization is transferred from
Mediterranean lands and from the Mediterranean
race to the North Sea and to the Nordic race.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE NORDIC RACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have shown that the Mediterranean race
entered Europe from the south and forms part of
a great group of peoples extending into southern
Asia, that the Alpine race came from the east
through Asia Minor and the valley of the Danube
and that its present European distribution is merely
the westernmost point of an ethnic pyramid, the
base of which rests solidly on the round skulled
peoples of the great plateaux of central Asia.
Both of these races are, therefore, western extensions
of Asiatic subspecies and neither of them can
be considered as exclusively European.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the remaining race, the Nordic, however,
the case is different. This is a purely European
type, in the sense that it has developed its physical
characters and its civilization within the confines
of that continent. It is, therefore, the <em>Homo europæus</em>,
the white man par excellence. It is everywhere
characterized by certain unique specializations,
namely, wavy brown or blond hair and blue,
gray or light brown eyes, fair skin, high, narrow
and straight nose, which are associated with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>stature and a long skull, as well as with abundant
head and body hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>A composite picture of this Nordic race and remarkable
examples of its best contemporary types
can be found in the English illustrated weeklies,
which are publishing during this great war the lists
and portraits of their officers who have fallen in
battle. No nation, not even England although
richly endowed with a Nordic gentry, can stand
the loss of so much good blood. Here is the evidence,
if such be needed, of the actual Passing of the
Great Race.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abundance of hair is an ancient and generalized
character which the Nordics share with the
Alpines of both Europe and Asia, but the light colored
eyes and light colored hair are characters of
relatively recent specialization and consequently
highly unstable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pure Nordic race is at present clustered
around the shores of the Baltic and North Seas
from which it has spread west and south and
east fading off gradually into the two preceding
races.</p>

<p class='c007'>The centre of its greatest purity is now in Sweden
and there is no doubt that at first the Scandinavian
Peninsula and later, also, the immediately
adjoining shores of the Baltic were the centres of
radiation of the Teutonic or Scandinavian branch
of this race.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>The population of Scandinavia has been composed
of this Nordic subspecies from the commencement
of Neolithic times and Sweden to-day represents
one of the few countries which has never been overwhelmed
by foreign conquest and in which there
has been but a single racial type from the beginning.
This nation is unique in its unity of race,
language, religion and social ideals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Southern Scandinavia only became fit for human
habitation on the retreat of the glaciers about
twelve thousand years ago and apparently was immediately
occupied by the Nordic race. This is one
of the few geological dates which is absolute and
not relative. It rests on a most interesting series
of computations made by Baron DeGeer, based on
an actual count of the laminated deposits of clay
laid down annually by the retreating glaciers, each
layer representing the summer deposit of the subglacial
stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordics first appear at the close of the
Paleolithic along the coasts of the Baltic. The
earliest industry discovered in this region, named
the Maglemose and found in Denmark and elsewhere
around the Baltic, is probably the culture
of the Proto-Teutonic branch of the Nordic race.
No human remains in connection therewith have
been found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vigor and power of the Nordic race as a
whole is such that it could not have been evolved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>in so restricted an area as southern Sweden although
its Teutonic or Scandinavian section did
develop there in comparative isolation. The Nordics
must have had a larger field for their specialization
and a longer period for their evolution than is
afforded by the limited time which has elapsed since
Sweden became habitable. For the development
of so marked a type there is required a continental
area isolated and protected for long ages from the
intrusion of other races. The climatic conditions
must have been such as to impose a rigid elimination
of defectives through the agency of hard
winters and the necessity of industry and foresight
in providing the year’s food, clothing and shelter
during the short summer. Such demands on energy
if long continued would produce a strong,
virile and self-contained race which would inevitably
overwhelm in battle nations whose weaker
elements had not been purged by the conditions of
an equally severe environment.</p>

<p class='c007'>An area conforming to these requirements is
offered by the forests and plains of eastern Germany,
Poland and Russia. It was here that the
Proto-Nordic type evolved and here their remnants
are found. They were protected from Asia on the
east by the then almost continuous water connections
across eastern Russia between the White Sea
and the old Caspian-Aral Sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last glacial advance (known as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Würm) which, like the preceding glaciations, is believed
to have been a period of land depression,
the White Sea extended far to the south of its
present limits, while the enlarged Caspian Sea,
then and long afterward connected with the Sea
of Aral, extended northward to the great bend of
the Volga. The intermediate area was studded
with large lakes and morasses. Thus an almost
complete water barrier of shallow sea located just
west of the low Ural Mountains, separated Europe
from Asia during the Würm glaciation and the
following period of glacial retreat. The broken
connection was restored just before the dawn of
history by a slight elevation of the land and the
shrinking of the Caspian-Aral Sea through the increasing
desiccation which has left its present surface
below sea level.</p>

<p class='c007'>An important element in the maintenance of
the isolation of this Nordic cradle on the south is
the fact that from earliest times down to this day
the pressure of population has been unchangeably
from the bleak and sterile north, southward and
eastward, into the sunny but enervating lands of
France, Italy, Greece, Persia and India.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these forests and steppes of the north, the
Nordic race gradually evolved in isolation and at
an early date spread north over the Scandinavian
Peninsula together with much of the land now submerged
under the Baltic and North Seas.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Nordic strains form everywhere a substratum
of population throughout Russia and underlie the
round skulled Slavs who first appear a little over a
thousand years ago as coming not from the direction
of Asia but from south Poland. Burial mounds
called kurgans are widely scattered throughout
Russia from the Carpathians to the Urals and contain
numerous remains of a dolichocephalic race,—in
fact, more than three-fourths of the skulls are
of this type. Round skulls first become numerous
in ancient Russian graveyards about 900 A. D.
and soon increase to such an extent that in the
Slavic period from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries
one-half of the skulls were brachycephalic,
while in modern cemeteries the proportion of round
skulls is still greater. The ancient Nordic element,
however, still forms a very considerable portion of
the population of northern Russia and contributes
the blondness and the red-headedness so characteristic
of the Russian of to-day. As we leave
the Baltic coasts the Nordic characters fade out
both toward the south and east. The blond element
in the nobility of Russia is of later Scandinavian
and Teutonic origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the seas which separated Russia from Asia
dried, when the isolation and exacting climate of
the north had done their work and produced the
vigorous Nordic type, and when in the fulness of
time bronze for their weapons reached them these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>men burst upon the southern races, conquering
east, south and west. They brought with them
from the north the hardihood and vigor acquired
under the rigorous selection of a long winter season
and vanquished in battle the inhabitants of older
and feebler civilizations, but only to succumb in
their turn to the softening influences of a life of
ease and plenty in their new homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earliest recorded appearance of Aryan-speaking
Nordics is our first dim vision of the
Sacæ introducing Sanskrit into India, the Cimmerians
pouring through the passes of the Caucasus
from the grasslands of South Russia to invade the
Empire of the Medes and the Achæans and
Phrygians conquering Greece and the Ægean coast
of Asia Minor. About 1100 B. C. Nordics enter
Italy as Umbrians and Oscans and soon after other
Nordics cross the Rhine into Gaul. The latter
were the western vanguard of the Celtic-speaking
tribes which had long occupied those districts in
Germany which lay south and west of the Teutonic
Nordics. These Teutons at this early date
were confined probably to Scandinavia and the
immediate shores of the Baltic and were just beginning
to press southward.</p>

<p class='c007'>This first Celtic wave of Nordics seems to have
swept westward along the sandy plains of northern
Europe, and entered France through the Low Countries.
From this point as Goidels they spread north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>into Britain, reaching there about 800 B. C. As
Gauls they conquered all France and pushed on
southward and westward into Spain and over the
Maritime Alps into northern Italy, where they encountered
the kindred Nordic Umbrians, who at an
earlier date had crossed the Alps from the northeast.
Other Celtic-speaking Nordics apparently migrated
up the Rhine and down the Danube and
by the time the Romans came on the scene the
Alpines of central Europe had been thoroughly
Celticized. These tribes pushed eastward into
southern Russia and reached the Crimea as early
as the fourth century B. C. Mixed with the natives,
they were called by the Greeks the Celto-Scyths.
This swarming out of what is now called
Germany of the first Nordics was during the closing
phases of the Bronze Period and was contemporary
with and probably caused by the first great
expansion of the Teutons from Scandinavia by way
both of Denmark and the Baltic coasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>These invaders were succeeded by a second wave
of Celtic-speaking peoples, the Cymry or Brythons,
who drove their Goidelic predecessors still farther
westward and exterminated and absorbed them
over large areas. These Cymric invasions occurred
about 300–100 B. C. and were probably the result
of the growing development of the Teutons and
their final expulsion of the Celtic-speaking tribes
from Germany. These Cymry occupied northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>France under the name of Belgæ and invaded England
as Brythons in several waves, the last being the
true Belgæ. The conquests of these Cymric tribes
in both Gaul and Britain were only checked by the
legions of Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>These migrations are exceedingly hard to trace
because of the confusion caused by the fact that
Celtic speech is now found on the lips of populations
in nowise related to the Nordics who first
introduced it. But one fact stands out clearly, all
the original Celtic-speaking tribes were Nordic.</p>

<p class='c007'>What were the special physical characters of
these tribes in which they differed from their Teutonic
successors is now impossible to say, beyond
the possible suggestion that in the British Isles the
Scottish and Irish populations in which red hair
and gray or green eyes are abundant have rather
more of this Celtic strain in them than have the
flaxen haired Teutons, whose china-blue eyes are
clearly not Celtic.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the peoples called Gauls or Celts by the
Romans and Galatians by the Greeks first appear
in history they are described in exactly the same
terms as were later the Teutons. They were all
gigantic barbarians with fair and very often red
hair, then more frequent than to-day, with gray or
fiercely blue eyes and were thus clearly members
of the Nordic subspecies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first Celtic-speaking nations with whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Romans came in contact were Gaulish and had
probably incorporated much Alpine blood by the
time they crossed the mountains into the domain
of classic history. The Nordic element had become
still weaker by absorption from the conquered
populations when at a later date the Romans
broke through the ring of Celtic nations and
came into contact with the Nordic Cymry and
Teutons.</p>

<p class='c007'>After these early expansions of Gauls and Cymry
the Teutons appear upon the scene. Of the pure
Teutons within the ken of history, it is not necessary
to mention more than the most important of
the long series of conquering tribes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest of them all were perhaps the
Goths, who came originally from the south of
Sweden and were long located on the opposite
German coast at the mouth of the Vistula. From
here they crossed Poland to the Crimea where they
were known in the first century. Three hundred
years later they were driven westward by the Huns
and forced into the Dacian plain and over the
Danube into the Roman Empire. There they split
up; the Ostrogoths after a period of subjection to
the Huns on the Danube, ravaged the European
provinces of the Eastern Empire, conquered Italy
and founded there a great but shortlived nation.
The Visigoths occupied much of Gaul and then
entered Spain driving the Nordic Vandals before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>them into Africa. The Teutons and Cimbri,
destroyed by Marius in southern Gaul about 100
B. C., the Gepidæ, the Alans, the Suevi, the Vandals,
the Alemanni of the upper Rhine, the Marcomanni,
the Saxons, the Batavians, the Frisians,
the Angles, the Jutes, the Lombards and the
Heruli of Italy, the Burgundians of the east of
France, the Franks of the lower Rhine, the Danes,
and, latest of all, the Norse Vikings emerge from
the northern forests and seas one after another and
sweep through history. Less well known but of
great importance are the Varangians, who coming
from Sweden in the ninth and tenth centuries, conquered
the coast of the Gulf of Finland and much
of White Russia and left there a dynasty and aristocracy
of Nordic blood. In the tenth and eleventh
centuries they were the rulers of Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The traditions of Goths, Vandals, Lombards and
Burgundians all point to Sweden as their earliest
homeland and probably all the pure Teutonic
tribes came originally from Scandinavia and were
closely related.</p>

<p class='c007'>When these Teutonic tribes poured down from
the Baltic coasts, their Celtic-speaking Nordic
predecessors were already much mixed with the
underlying populations, Mediterranean in the west
and Alpine in the south. These “Celts” were not
recognized by the Teutons as kin in any sense
and were all called, Welsh, or foreigners. From this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>word are derived the names “Wales,” “Cornwales”
or “Cornwall,” “Valais,” “Walloons,” and
“Vlach” or “Wallachian.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>VII<br /> <span class='large'>TEUTONIC EUROPE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No proper understanding is possible of the
meaning of the history of Christendom or full appreciation
of the place in it of the Teutonic Nordics
without a brief review of the events in Europe
of the last two thousand years.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Rome fell and changed trade conditions
necessitated the transfer of power from its historic
capital in Italy to a strategic situation on the Bosporus,
western Europe was definitely and finally
abandoned to its Teutonic invaders. These same
barbarians swept up again and again to the Propontis,
only to recoil before the organized strength
of the Byzantine Empire and the walls of Mikklegard.
The final line of cleavage between the western
and eastern Empires corresponded closely to
the boundaries of Latin and Greek speech and differences
of language no doubt were the chief cause
of the political and later of the religious divergence
between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until the coming of the Alpine Slavs the Eastern
Empire still held in Europe the Balkan Peninsula
and much of the eastern Mediterranean. The
Western Empire, however, collapsed utterly under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the impact of hordes of Nordic Teutons at a
much earlier date. In the fourth and fifth centuries
of our era north Africa, once the empire of
Carthage, had become the seat of the kingdom of
Nordic Vandals. Spain fell under the control of
the Visigoths and Lusitania, now Portugal, under
that of the Suevi. Gaul was Visigothic in the
south and Burgundian in the east, while the
Frankish kingdom dominated the north until it
finally absorbed and incorporated all the territories
of ancient Gaul and made it the land of the Franks.
Strictly speaking, the northern half of France and
the adjoining districts, the country of Langued’oil,
is the true land of the Franks while the southern
Languedoc was never Frankish except by conquest,
and was never as thoroughly Nordicized as the
north. Whatever Nordic elements are still to be
found there are Gothic and Burgundian but not
Frankish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Italy fell under the control first of the Ostrogoths
and then of the Lombards. The purely
Nordic Saxons with kindred tribes conquered the
British Isles and meanwhile the Norse and Danish
Scandinavians contributed a large element to all
the coast populations as far south as Spain and
the Swedes organized in the eastern Baltic what
is now Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus when Rome passed all Europe had become
superficially Teutonic. At first these Teutons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>were isolated and independent tribes bearing some
shadowy relation to the one organized state they
knew, the Empire of Rome. Then came the Mohammedan
invasion, which reached western Europe
from Africa and destroyed the Visigothic
kingdom. The Moslems swept on unchecked
until their light horsemen dashed themselves to
pieces against the heavy armed cavalry of Charles
Martel and his Franks at Tours in 732 A. D.</p>

<p class='c007'>The destruction of the Vandal kingdom by the
armies of the Byzantine Empire, the conquest of
Spain by the Moors and finally the overthrow of
the Lombards by the Franks were all greatly facilitated
by the fact that these barbarians, Vandals,
Goths, Suevi and Lombards, with the sole exception
of the Franks, were originally Christians
of the Arian or Unitarian confession and as
such were regarded as heretics by their orthodox
Christian subjects. The Franks alone were converted
from heathenism directly to the Trinitarian
faith to which the old populations of the
Roman Empire adhered. From this orthodoxy
of the Franks arose the close relation between
France, “the eldest daughter of the church,” and
the papacy, a connection which lasted for more
than a thousand years—in fact nearly to our own
day.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the Goths eliminated western Christendom
became Frankish. In the year 800 A. D.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Charlemagne was crowned at Rome and re-established
the Roman Empire in the west, which included
all Christendom outside of the Byzantine
Empire. In some form or shape this Roman
Empire endured until the beginning of the nineteenth
century and during all that time it formed
the basis of the political concept of European
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>This same concept lies to-day at the root of the
imperial idea. Kaiser, Tsar and Emperor each
takes his name and in some way undertakes to
trace his title from Cæsar and the Empire. Charlemagne
and his successors claimed and often exercised
overlordship as to all the other continental
Christian nations and when the Crusades began
it was the German Emperor who led the Frankish
hosts against the Saracens. Charlemagne was a
German Emperor, his capital was at Aachen within
the present limits of the German Empire and the
language of his court was German. For several
centuries after the conquest of Gaul by the Franks
their Teutonic tongue held its own against the
Latin speech of the Romanized Gauls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of all Christian Europe is in some
degree interwoven with this Holy Roman Empire.
Though the Empire was neither holy nor
Roman but altogether secular and Teutonic, it
was, nevertheless, the heart of Europe for ages.
Holland and Flanders, Lorraine and Alsace, Burgundy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and Luxemburg, Lombardy and the Veneto,
Switzerland and Austria, Bohemia and Styria are
states which were originally component parts of
the Empire although many of them have since
been torn away by rival nations or have become independent,
while much of northern Italy remained
under the sway of Austria within the memory of
living men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Empire wasted its strength in imperial ambitions
and foreign conquests instead of consolidating,
organizing and unifying its own territories
and the fact that the imperial crown was elective
for many generations before it became hereditary
in the House of Hapsburg checked the unification
of Germany during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strong hereditary monarchy, such as arose in
England and in France, would have anticipated
the Germany of to-day by a thousand years and
made it the predominant state in Christendom,
but disruptive elements in the persons of great
territorial dukes were successful throughout its
history in preventing an effective concentration of
power in the hands of the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the German Emperor was regarded, though
vaguely, as the overlord of all Christian monarchs
was clearly indicated when Henry VIII of England
and Francis I of France appeared as candidates
for the imperial crown against Charles of Spain,
afterward the Emperor Charles V.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Europe was the Holy Roman Empire and the
Holy Roman Empire was Europe predominantly
until the Thirty Years’ War. This war was perhaps
the greatest catastrophe of all the ghastly
crimes committed in the name of religion. It destroyed
an entire generation, taking each year for
thirty years the finest manhood of the nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two-thirds of the population of Germany was
destroyed, in some states such as Bohemia three-fourths
of the inhabitants were killed or exiled,
while out of 500,000 inhabitants in Würtemberg
there were only 48,000 left at the end of the war.
Terrible as this loss was, the destruction did not
fall equally on the various races and classes in
the community. It bore, of course, most heavily
upon the big blond fighting man and at the end
of the war the German states contained a greatly
lessened proportion of Nordic blood. In fact,
from that time on the purely Teutonic race in
Germany has been largely replaced by the Alpine
types in the south and by the Wendish and
the Polish types in the east. This change of race
in Germany has gone so far that it has been computed
that out of the 70,000,000 inhabitants of
the German Empire, only 9,000,000 are purely
Teutonic in coloration, stature and skull characters.
The rarity of pure Teutonic and Nordic
types among the German immigrants to America in
contrast to its almost universal prevalence among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>those from Scandinavia is traceable to the same
cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition, the Thirty Years’ War virtually
destroyed the land owning yeomanry and lesser
gentry formerly found in mediæval Germany as
numerously as in France or in England. The religious
wars of France, while not as devasting to
the nation as a whole as was the Thirty Years’ War
in Germany, nevertheless greatly weakened the
French cavalier type, the “petite noblesse de province.”
In Germany this class had flourished and
throughout the Middle Ages contributed great
numbers of knights, poets, thinkers, artists and
artisans who gave charm and variety to the society
of central Europe. But, as said, this section of
the population was practically exterminated in the
Thirty Years’ War and this class of gentlemen
practically vanishes from German history from
that time on.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Thirty Years’ War was over there remained
in Germany nothing except the brutalized
peasantry, largely of Alpine derivation in the
south and east, and the high nobility which turned
from the toils of endless warfare to mimic on a
small scale the court of Versailles. After this long
struggle the boundaries in central Europe between
the Protestant North and the Catholic South follow
in a marked degree the frontier between the
northern plain inhabited chiefly by Nordics and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the more mountainous countries in the south populated
almost entirely by Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has taken Germany two centuries to recover
her vigor, her wealth and her aspirations to a place
in the sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>During these years Germany was a political nonentity,
a mere congeries of petty states bickering
and fighting with each other, claiming and owning
only the Empire of the Air as Napoleon happily
phrased it. Meantime France and England
founded their colonial empires beyond the seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>When in the last generation Germany became
unified and organized, she found herself not only
too late to share in these colonial enterprises, but
also lacking in much of the racial element and still
more lacking in the very classes which were her
greatest strength and glory before the Thirty Years’
War. To-day the ghastly rarity in the German
armies of chivalry and generosity toward women
and of knightly protection and courtesy toward the
prisoners or wounded can be largely attributed to
this annihilation of the gentle classes. The Germans
of to-day, whether they live on the farms
or in the cities, are for the most part descendants
of the peasants who survived, not of the brilliant
knights and sturdy foot soldiers who fell in that
mighty conflict. Knowledge of this great past
when Europe was Teutonic and memories of the
shadowy grandeur of the Hohenstaufen Emperors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>who, generation after generation, led Teutonic
armies over the Alps to assert their title to Italian
provinces, have played no small part in modern
German consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>These traditions and the knowledge that their
own religious dissensions swept them from the
leadership of the European world lie at the base
of the German imperial ideal of to-day and it is
for this ideal that the German armies are dying,
just as did their ancestors for a thousand years
under their Fredericks, Henrys, Conrads and Ottos.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Empire of Rome and the Empire of
Charlemagne are no more and the Teutonic type
is divided almost equally between the contending
forces in this world war. With the United States
in the field the balance of pure Nordic blood will
be heavily against the Central Powers, which pride
themselves on being “the Teutonic powers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Germany is too late and is limited to a destiny
fixed and ordained for her on the fatal day in 1618
when the Hapsburg Ferdinand forced the Protestants
of Bohemia into revolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although as a result of the Thirty Years’ War the
German Empire is far less Nordic than in the Middle
Ages, the north and northwest of Germany are
still Teutonic throughout and in the east and south
the Alpines have been thoroughly Germanized with
an aristocracy and upper class very largely of pure
Teutonic blood.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE EXPANSION OF THE NORDICS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The men of Nordic blood to-day form practically
all the population of Scandinavian countries,
as also a majority of the population of the British
Isles and are almost pure in type in Scotland and
eastern and northern England. The Nordic realm
includes nearly all the northern third of France
with extensions into the fertile southwest; all the
rich lowlands of Flanders; all Holland; the northern
half of Germany with extensions up the Rhine
and down the Danube; and the north of Poland
and of Russia. Recent calculations indicate that
there are about 90,000,000 of purely Nordic physical
type in Europe out of a total population of
420,000,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout southern Europe a Nordic nobility
of Teutonic type everywhere forms the old aristocratic
and military classes or what now remains
of them. These aristocrats, by as much as their
blood is pure, are taller and blonder than the native
populations, whether these be Alpine in central
Europe or Mediterranean in Spain or in the south
of France and Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The countries speaking Low German dialects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>are almost purely Nordic but the populations of
High German speech are very largely Teutonized
Alpines and occupy lands once Celtic-speaking.
The main distinction between the two dialects is
the presence of a large number of Celtic elements
in High German.</p>

<p class='c007'>In northern Italy there is a large amount of Nordic
blood. In Lombardy, Venice and elsewhere
throughout the country the aristocracy is blonder
and taller than the peasantry, but the Nordic element
in Italy has declined noticeably since the
Middle Ages. From Roman times onward for a
thousand years the Teutons swarmed into northern
Italy, through the Alps and chiefly by way of
the Brenner Pass. With the stoppage of these
Nordic reinforcements this strain seems to have
grown less all through Italy.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Procopius tells a significant story which illustrates the contrast in
racial character between the natives and the barbarians. He relates
that, at the surrender of Ravenna in 540 A. D. by the Goths to the army
of the Byzantines, “when the Gothic women saw how swarthy, small
men of mean aspect had conquered their tall, robust, fair-skinned barbarians,
they were furious and spat in their husbands’ faces and cursed
them for cowards.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Balkan Peninsula there is little to show
for the floods of Nordic blood that have poured in
for the last 3,500 years, beginning with the Achæans
of Homer, who first appeared <em>en masse</em> about
1400 B. C. and were followed successively by the
Dorians, Cimmerians and Gauls, down to the
Goths and the Varangians of Byzantine times.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>The tall stature of the population along the
Illyrian Alps from the Tyrol to Albania on the
south is undoubtedly of Nordic origin and dates
from some of these early invasions, but these Illyrians
have been so crossed with Slavs that all
other blond elements have been lost and the existing
population is essentially of brachycephalic
Alpine type. They are known as the Dinaric race.
What few remnants of blondness occur in this district,
more particularly in Albania, as well as the
so-called Frankish elements in Bosnia, may probably
be attributed to later infiltrations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Tyrolese seem to be largely Nordic except in
respect to their round skull.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Russia and in Poland the Nordic stature,
blondness and long skull grow less and less pronounced
as one proceeds south and east from the
Gulf of Finland.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would appear that in all those parts of Europe
outside of its natural habitat, the Nordic
blood is on the wane from England to Italy and
that the ancient, acclimated and primitive populations
of Alpine and Mediterranean race are subtly
reasserting their long lost political power through
a high breeding rate and democratic institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In western Europe the first wave of the Nordic
tribes appeared about three thousand years ago and
was followed by other invasions with the Nordic
element becoming stronger until after the fall of
Rome whole tribes moved into its provinces, Teutonizing
them more or less for varying lengths of
time.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>These incoming Nordics intermarried with the
native populations and were gradually bred out
and the resurgence of the old native stock, chiefly
Alpine, has proceeded steadily since the Frankish
Charlemagne destroyed the Lombard kingdom and
is proceeding with unabated vigor to-day. This
process was greatly accelerated in western Europe
by the Crusades, which were extremely destructive
to the Nordic feudal lords, especially the Frankish
and Norman nobility and was continued by the
wars of the Reformation and by those of the Revolution.
The world war now in full swing with its
toll of millions will leave Europe much poorer in
Nordic blood. One of its most certain results will
be the partial destruction of the aristocratic classes
everywhere in northern Europe. In England the
nobility has already suffered in battle more than in
any century since the Wars of the Roses. This will
tend to realize the standardization of type so dear
to democratic ideals. If equality cannot be obtained
by lengthening and uplifting the stunted of
body and of mind, it can be at least realized by the
destruction of the exalted of stature and of soul.
The bed of Procrustes operates with the same
fatal exactness when it shortens the long as when it
stretches the undersized.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>The first Nordics in Spain were the Gauls who
crossed the western Pyrenees about the end of the
sixth century before our era and introduced Aryan
speech into the Iberian Peninsula. They quickly
mixed with Mediterranean natives and the composite
Spaniards were called Celtiberians by the
Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Portugal and Spain there are in the physical
structure of the population few traces of these
early Celtic-speaking Nordic invaders but the
Suevi, who a thousand years later occupied parts
of Portugal, and the Vandals and Visigoths, who
conquered and held Spain for 300 years, have left
some small evidence of their blood. In the provinces
of northern Spain a considerable percentage
of light colored eyes reveals these Nordic elements
in the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deep seated Castilian traditions associate aristocracy
with blondness and the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">sangre azul</span></i>, or blue
blood of Spain, probably refers to the blue eye
of the Goth, whose traditional claim to lordship
is also shown in the Spanish name for gentleman,
“hidalgo,” said to mean “the son of the Goth.”
The fact that the blood shows as “blue” through the
fair Nordic skin is also to be taken into account.</p>

<p class='c007'>As long as this Gothic nobility controlled the
Spanish states during the endless crusades against
the Moors, Spain belonged to the Nordic kingdoms,
but when their blood became impaired by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>losses in wars waged outside of Spain and in the
conquest of the Americas, the sceptre fell from this
noble race into the hands of the native Iberian,
who had not the physical vigor or the intellectual
strength to maintain the world empire built up by
the stronger race. For 200 years the Spanish infantry
had no equal in Europe but this distinction
disappeared with the opening decades of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p class='c007'>The splendid conquistadores of the New World
were of Nordic type, but their pure stock did not
long survive their new surroundings and to-day
they have vanished utterly, leaving behind them
only their language and their religion. After considering
well these facts we shall not have to search
further for the causes of the collapse of Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gaul at the time of Cæsar’s conquest was under
the rule of the Nordic race, which furnished the
bulk of the population of the north as well as the
military classes elsewhere and, while the Romans
killed off an undue proportion of this fighting element,
the power and vigor of the French nation
have been based on this blood and its later reinforcements.
In fact, in the Europe of to-day the
amount of Nordic blood in each nation is a very
fair measure of its strength in war and standing in
civilization. The proportion of men of pure type
of each constituent race to the mixed type is also
a powerful factor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>When, about 1000 B. C., the first Nordics crossed
the lower Rhine they found the Mediterranean
race in France everywhere overwhelmed by an
Alpine population except in the south. Long before
the time of Cæsar the Celtic language of these
invaders had been imposed upon the entire population
and the country had been saturated with
Nordic blood, except in Aquitaine which seems to
have retained until at least that date its Anaryan
Iberian speech. These earliest Nordics in the
west were known to the ancient world as Gauls.
These Gauls, or “Celts,” as they were called by
Cæsar, occupied in his day the centre of France.
The actual racial complexion of this part of France
was overwhelmingly Alpine then and is so now,
but this population had been Celticized thoroughly
by the Gauls, just as it was Latinized as completely
at a later date by the Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>The northern third of France, that is above
Paris, was inhabited in Cæsar’s time by the Belgæ,
a Nordic people of the Cymric division of Celtic
speech. They were largely of Teutonic blood and
in fact should be regarded as the immediate forerunners
of the Germans. They probably represent
the early Teutons who had crossed from Sweden
and adopted the Celtic speech of their Nordic
kindred whom they found on the mainland. These
Belgæ had followed the earlier Goidels across Germany
into Britain and Gaul and were rapidly displacing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>their Nordic predecessors, who by this
time were much weakened by mixture with the
autochthones, when Rome appeared upon the
scene and set a limit to their conquests by the Pax
Romana.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Belgæ of the north of France and the Low
Countries were the bravest of the peoples of Gaul,
according to Cæsar’s oft-quoted remark, but the
claim of the modern Belgians to descent from this
race is without basis and rests solely on the fact
that the present kingdom of Belgium, which only
became independent and assumed its proud name
in 1831, occupies a small and relatively unimportant
corner of the land of the Belgæ. The Flemings
of Belgium are Nordic Franks speaking a
Low German tongue and the Walloons are Alpines
whose language is an archaic French.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Belgæ and the Goidelic remnants of Nordic
blood in the centre of Gaul taken together probably
constituted only a small minority in blood of
the population, but were everywhere the military
and ruling classes. These Nordic elements were
later reinforced by powerful Teutonic tribes,
namely, Vandals, Visigoths, Alans, Saxons, Burgundians
and, most important of all, the Franks of
the lower Rhine, who founded modern France and
made it for long centuries “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande nation</span></i>” of
Christendom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Frankish dynasties long after Charlemagne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>were of purely Teutonic blood and the aristocratic
land owning and military classes down to the great
Revolution were very largely of this type, which
by the time of the creation of the Frankish kingdom
had incorporated all the other Nordic elements
of old Roman Gaul, both Gaulish and Belgic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last invasion of Teutonic-speaking barbarians
was that of the Danish Northmen, who were,
of course, of unmixed Nordic blood and who conquered
and settled Normandy in 911 A. D. No
sooner had the barbarian invasions ceased than
the ancient aboriginal blood strains, Mediterranean,
Alpine and elements derived from Paleolithic
times, began a slow and steady recovery. Step by
step with the reappearance of these primitive and
deep rooted stocks the Nordic element in France
declined and with it the vigor of the nation.
Even in Normandy the Alpines now tend to predominate
and the French blonds are becoming
more and more limited to the northeastern and
eastern provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief historic events of the last thousand
years have hastened this process and the fact that
the Nordic element everywhere forms the fighting
section of the community caused the loss in war
to fall disproportionately as among the three races
in France. The religious wars greatly weakened
the Nordic provincial nobility, which was before
the Massacre of St. Bartholomew largely Protestant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>and the extermination of the upper classes
was hastened by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic
wars. These last wars are said to have shortened
the stature of the French by four inches; in other
words, the tall Nordic strain was killed off in
greater proportions than the little brunet.</p>

<p class='c007'>When by universal suffrage the transfer of power
was completed from a Nordic aristocracy to lower
classes predominantly of Alpine and Mediterranean
extraction, the decline of France in international
power set in. In the country as a whole, the long
skulled Mediterraneans are also yielding rapidly to
the round skulled Alpines and the average of the
cephalic index in France has steadily risen since
the Middle Ages and is still rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>The survivors of the aristocracy, being stripped
of political power and to a large extent of wealth,
quickly lost their caste pride and committed class
suicide by mixing their blood with inferior breeds.
One of the most conspicuous features of some of
the French nobility of to-day is the strength of
Oriental and Mediterranean strains in them. Being
for political reasons ardently clerical the nobility
welcomes recruits of any racial origin as long
as they bring with them money and devotion to
the Church.</p>

<p class='c007'>The loss in war of the best stock through death,
wounds or absence from home has been clearly
shown in France. The conscripts who were examined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>for military duty in 1890–2 were those descended
in a large measure from the military rejects
and other stay-at-homes during the Franco-Prussian
War. In Dordogne this contingent showed
seven per cent more deficient statures than the
normal rate. In some cantons this unfortunate
generation was in height an inch below the recruits
of preceding years and in it the exemptions for defective
physique rose from the normal six per cent
to sixteen per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>When each generation is decimated or destroyed
in turn a race can be injured beyond recovery but
it more frequently happens that the result is the
annihilation of an entire class, as in the case of the
German gentry in the Thirty Years’ War. Desolation
of wide districts often resulted from the
plagues and famines which followed the armies in
old days but deaths from these causes fall most
heavily on the weaker part of the population. The
loss of valuable breeding stock is far more serious
when wars are fought with volunteer armies of
picked men than with conscript armies, because
in the latter cases the loss is more evenly spread
over the whole nation. Before England resorted
in the present war to universal conscription the injury
to her more desirable and patriotic classes was
much more pronounced than in Germany where all
types and ranks were called to arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the British Isles we find, before the appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of the Nordic race, a Mediterranean population and
no important element of Alpine blood, so that at
the present day we have to deal with only two of
the main races instead of all three as in France.
In Britain there were, as elsewhere, representatives
of earlier races but the preponderant strain of
blood was Mediterranean before the first arrival of
the Aryan-speaking Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ireland was connected with Britain and Britain
with the continent until times very recent in a
geological sense. The depression of the Channel
coasts is progressing rapidly to-day and is known
to have been substantial during historic times.
The close parallel in blood and culture between
England and the opposite coasts of France also indicates
a very recent land connection, possibly in
early Neolithic times. Men either walked from
the continent to England and from England to Ireland,
or they paddled across in primitive boats or
coracles. The art of ship-building or even archaic
navigation cannot go much further back than late
Neolithic times.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordic tribes of Celtic speech came to the
British Isles in two distinct waves. The earlier
invasion of the Goidels, who were still in the Bronze
culture, arrived in England about 800 B. C. and
in Ireland two centuries later. It was part of the
same movement which brought the Gauls into
France. The later conquest was by the Cymric-speaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Belgæ who were equipped with iron
weapons. It began in the third century B. C. and
was still going on in Cæsar’s time. These Cymric
Brythons found the early Goidels, with the exception
of the aristocracy, much weakened by intermixture
with the Mediterranean natives and would
probably have destroyed all trace of Goidelic speech
in Ireland and Scotland, as they actually did in
England, if the Romans had not intervened. The
Brythons reached Ireland in small numbers only
in the second century B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Nordic elements in Britain, both Goidelic
and Brythonic, were in a minority during Roman
times and the ethnic complexion of the island was
not much affected by the Roman occupation, as
the legions stationed there represented the varied
racial stocks of the Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the Romans abandoned Britain and about
400 A. D., floods of pure Nordics poured into the
islands for nearly six centuries, arriving in the north
as the Norse pirates, who made Scotland Scandinavian,
and in the east as Saxons and Angles, who
founded England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Angles came from somewhere in central
Jutland and the Saxons came from coast lands
immediately at the base of the Danish Peninsula.
All these districts were then and are now almost
purely Teutonic; in fact, this is part of old Saxony
and is to-day the core of Teutonic Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>These Saxon districts sent out at that time
swarms of invaders not only into England but into
France and over the Alps into Italy, just as at a
much later period the same land sent swarming
colonies into Hungary and Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same Saxon invaders passed down the Channel
coasts and traces of their settlement on the
mainland remain to this day in the Cotentin district
around Cherbourg. Scandinavian sea peoples
called Danes or Northmen swarmed over as late
as 900 A. D. and conquered all eastern England.
This Danish invasion of England was the same that
brought the Northmen or Normans into France.
In fact the occupation of Normandy was probably
by Danes and the conquest of England was largely
the work of Norsemen, as Norway at that time
was under Danish kings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both of these invasions, especially the later, swept
around the greater island and inundated Ireland,
driving both the Neolithic aborigines and their
Celtic-speaking masters into the bogs and islands
of the west.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blond Nordic element to-day is very marked
in Ireland as in England. It is derived, to some
extent, from the early invaders of Celtic speech,
but the Goidelic element has been very largely
absorbed in Ireland as in western England and in
Scotland by the Iberian substratum of the population
and is found to-day rather in the form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Nordic characters in brunets than in the entirely
blond individuals who represent later and purer
Nordic strains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The figures for recruits taken some decades ago
in the two countries would indicate that the Irish
as a whole are considerably lighter in eye and
darker in hair color than are the English. The
combination of black Iberian hair with blue or gray
Nordic eyes is frequently found in Ireland and also
in Spain and in both these countries is justly admired
for its beauty, but it is by no means an
exclusively Irish type.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tall, blond Irishmen are to-day chiefly Danish
with the addition of English, Norman and
Scotch elements, which have poured into the
lesser island for a thousand years and have imposed
the English speech upon it. The more primitive
and ancient elements in Ireland have always
shown great ability to absorb newcomers and
during the Middle Ages it was notorious that the
Norman and English colonists quickly sank to the
cultural level of the natives.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the fact that Paleoliths have not been
found there some indications of Paleolithic man
appear in Ireland both as single characters and as
individuals. Being, like Brittany, situated on the
extreme western outposts of Eurasia, it has more
than its share of generalized and low types surviving
in the living populations and these types,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the Firbolgs, have imparted a distinct and very
undesirable aspect to a large portion of the inhabitants
of the west and south and have greatly
lowered the intellectual status of the population as
a whole. The cross between these elements and the
Nordics appears to be a bad one and the mental
and cultural traits of the aborigines have proved
to be exceedingly persistent and appear especially
in the unstable temperament and the lack of coordinating
and reasoning power, so often found
among the Irish. To the dominance of the Mediterraneans
mixed with Pre-Neolithic survivals in the
south and west are to be attributed the aloofness
of the island from the general trend of European
civilization and its long adherence to ancient forms
of religion and even to Pre-Christian superstitions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England, the same two ethnic elements are
present, namely the Nordic and the Mediterranean.
There is, especially in Wales and in the west central
counties of England, a large substratum of ancient
Mediterranean blood but the later Nordic
elements are everywhere superimposed upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scotland is by race Anglian in the Lowlands and
Norse in the Highlands with underlying Goidelic
and Brythonic elements, which are exceedingly
hard to identify. The Mediterranean strain is
marked in the Highlands and is frequently associated
with tall stature.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>This brunetness in Scotland is, of course, derived
from the same underlying Mediterranean stock
which we have found elsewhere in the British
Islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inhabitants of Scotland before the arrival
of the Celtic-speaking Nordics seem to have been
the Picts, whose language was almost surely Non-Aryan.
Judging from the remnants of Anaryan
syntax in the Goidelic and to a lesser degree in
the Cymric languages, Pictish was related to the
Anaryan Berber tongues still spoken in North
Africa. No trace of this Pre-Aryan syntax is found
in English.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where one race imposes a new language on another,
the change is most marked in the vocabulary
while the ancient usage in syntax or the construction
of sentences is the more apt to survive and these
ancient forms often give us a valuable clew to the
aboriginal speech. This same Anaryan syntax is
particularly marked in the Irish language, a condition
which fits in with the other Pre-Aryan usages
and types found there.</p>

<p class='c007'>This divergence between the new vocabulary and
the ancient habits of syntax is probably one of
the causes of the extreme splitting up of the various
branches of the Aryan mother tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wales, like western Ireland, is a museum of
racial antiquities and being an unattractive and
poor country has exported men rather than received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>immigration, while such invasions as did
arrive came with spent force.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mass of the population of Wales especially
in the upland or moorland districts is Mediterranean,
with a considerable addition of Paleolithic
remnants. With changing social and industrial
conditions these Neolithic Mediterraneans are pushing
into the valleys or towns with a resultant replacement
of the Nordic types.</p>

<p class='c007'>Recent and intensive investigations reveal everywhere
in Wales distinct physical types living side
by side or in adjoining villages unchanged and unchangeable
throughout the centuries. Extensive
blending has not taken place though much crossing
has occurred and the persistence of the skull
shape has been particularly marked. Such individuals
as are of pure Nordic type are generally
members of the old county families and land owning
class.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to language in Wales, the Cymric is everywhere
spoken in various dialects, but there are indications
of the ancient underlying Goidelic. In
fact, Brythonic or Cymric may not have reached
Wales much before the Roman conquest of Britain.
The earlier Goidelic survived in parts of
Wales as late as the seventh century but by the
eleventh century all consciousness of race and linguistic
distinctions had disappeared in the common
name of Cymry. This name should perhaps be limited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>to the Brythons of England and not used for
their kindred on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Cornwall and along the Welsh border racial
types are often grouped in separate villages and
the intellectual and moral distinctions between
them are well recognized.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordic species of man in its various branches
made Gaul the land of the Franks and made Britain
the land of the Angles and the Englishmen
who built the British Empire and founded America
were of the Nordic and not of the Mediterranean
type.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most vigorous Nordic elements in
France, England and America was contributed by
the Normans and their influence on the development
of these countries cannot be ignored. The
descendants of the Danish and Norse Vikings who
settled in Normandy as Teutonic-speaking heathen
and who as Normans crossed over to Saxon England
and conquered it in 1066 are among the
finest and noblest examples of the Nordic race.
Their only rivals in these characters were the
early Goths.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Norman strain, while purely Nordic, seems
to have been radically different in its mental makeup,
and to some extent in its physical detail from
the Saxons of England and also from their kindred
in Scandinavia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Normans appear to have been “<em>fine race</em>” to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>use a French idiom and their descendants are often
characterized by a tall, slender figure, much less
bulky than the typical Teuton, of proud bearing
and with clearly marked features of classic Greek
regularity. The type is seldom extremely blond
and is often dark. These Latinized Vikings were
and are animated by a restless and nomadic energy
and by a fierce aggressiveness. They played a
brilliant role during the twelfth and following centuries
but later, on the continent, this strain ran
out, though leaving here and there traces of its
former presence, notably in Sicily where the grayish
blue Sicilian eye called “the Norman eye” is
still found among the old noble families.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Norman type is still very common among
the English of good family and especially among
hunters, explorers, navigators, adventurers and officers
in the British army. These latter-day Normans
are natural rulers and administrators and it
is to this type that England largely owes her
extraordinary ability to govern justly and firmly
the lower races. This Norman blood occurs often
among the native Americans but with the changing
social conditions and the filling up of the waste
places of the earth it is doomed to a speedy
extinction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Normans were Nordics with a dash of brunet
blood and their conquest of England strengthened
the Nordic and not the Mediterranean elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>in the British Isles, but the connection once established
with France especially with Aquitaine later
introduced from southern France certain brunet
elements of Mediterranean affinities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The upper class Normans on their arrival in
England were probably purely Scandinavian, but
in the lower classes there were some dark strains.
They brought with them large numbers of ecclesiastics
who were, for the most part drawn from the
more ancient types throughout France. Careful
investigation of the graveyards and vaults in which
these churchmen were buried revealed a large percentage
of round skulls among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both Normandy and in the lowlands of Scotland
there was much the same mixture of blood
between Scandinavian and Saxon but with a smaller
amount of Saxon blood in France. The result in
both cases was the production of an extraordinarily
forceful race.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordics in England are in these days
apparently receding before the Neolithic Mediterranean
type. The causes of this decline are
the same as in France and the chief loss is through
the wastage of blood by war and through emigration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The typical British soldier is blond or red bearded
and the typical sailor is always a blond. The migrating
type from England is also chiefly Nordic.
These facts would indicate that nomadism as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>as love of war and adventure are Nordic characteristics.</p>

<p class='c007'>An extremely potent influence, however, is the
transformation of the nation from an agricultural
to a manufacturing community. Heavy, healthful
work in the fields of northern Europe enables the
Nordic type to thrive, but the cramped factory
and crowded city quickly weed him out, while the
little brunet Mediterranean can work a spindle,
set type, sell ribbons or push a clerk’s pen far better
than the big, clumsy and somewhat heavy Nordic
blond, who needs exercise, meat and air and cannot
live under Ghetto conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The increase of urban communities at the expense
of the countryside is also an important element
in the fading of the Nordic type, because the
energetic countryman of this blood is more apt to
improve his fortunes by moving to the city than the
less ambitious Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>The country villages and the farms are the nurseries
of nations, while cities are consumers and
seldom producers of men. The effort now being
made in America to settle undesirable immigrants
on farms may, from the viewpoint of race replacement,
be more dangerous than allowing them to
remain in crowded Ghettos or tenements.</p>

<p class='c007'>If England has deteriorated and there are those
who think they see indications of such decline, it is
due to the lowering proportion of the Nordic blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>and the transfer of political power from the vigorous
Nordic aristocracy and middle classes to the
radical and labor elements, both largely recruited
from the Mediterranean type.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only in Scandinavia and northwestern Germany
does the Nordic race seem to maintain its full vigor
in spite of the enormous wastage of three thousand
years of the swarming forth of its best fighting men.
Norway, however, after the Viking outburst has
never exhibited military power and Sweden, in the
centuries between the Varangian period and the rise
of Gustavus Adolphus, did not enjoy a reputation
for fighting efficiency. All the three Scandinavian
countries after vigorously attacking Christendom
a thousand years ago disappear from history as a
nursery for soldiers until the Reformation when
Sweden suddenly reappears just in time to save
Protestantism on the Continent. To-day all three
seem to be intellectually anæmic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upper and Lower Austria, the Tyrol and Styria
have a very considerable Nordic element which is
in political control but the Alpine races are slowly
replacing the Nordics both there and in Hungary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holland and Flanders are purely Teutonic, the
Flemings being the descendants of those Franks
who did not adopt Latin speech as did their Teutonic
kin across the border in Artois and Picardy;
and Holland is the ancient Batavia with the Frisian
coast lands eastward to old Saxony.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Denmark, Norway and Sweden are purely Nordic
and yearly contribute swarms of a splendid type
of immigrants to America and are now, as they
have been for thousands of years, the chief nursery
and broodland of the master race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In southwestern Norway and in Denmark, there
is a substantial number of short, dark round heads
of Alpine affinities. These dark Norwegians are
regarded as somewhat inferior socially by their
Nordic countrymen. Perhaps as a result of this
disability, a disproportionately large number of
Norwegian immigrants to America are of this type.
Apparently America is doomed to receive in these
later days the least desirable classes and types
from each European nation now exporting men.</p>

<p class='c007'>In mediæval times the Norse and Danish Vikings
sailed not only the waters of the known Atlantic,
but ventured westward through the fogs
and frozen seas to Iceland, Greenland and America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sweden, after sending forth her Goths and other
early Teutonic tribes, turned her attention to the
shores of the eastern Baltic, colonized the coast
of Finland and the Baltic provinces and supplied
also a strong Scandinavian element to the aristocracy
of Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coast of Finland is as a result Swedish and
the natives of the interior have distinctly Nordic
characters with the exception of the skull, which
in its roundness shows an Alpine cross.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>The population of the so-called Baltic provinces
of Russia is everywhere Nordic and their affinities
are with Scandinavia and Germany rather than
with Slavic Moscovy. The most primitive Aryan
languages, namely, Lettish, Lithuanian and the
recently extinct Old Prussian, are found in this
neighborhood and here we are not far from the
original Nordic homeland.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE NORDIC FATHERLAND</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The area in Europe where the Nordic race developed
and in which the Aryan languages originated
probably included the forest region of eastern
Germany, Poland and Russia, together with
the grasslands which stretched from the Ukraine
eastward into the steppes south of the Ural. From
causes already mentioned this area was long isolated
from the rest of the world and especially from
Asia. When the unity of the Aryan race and of
the Aryan language was broken up at the end of
the Neolithic and the beginning of the Bronze
Age, wave after wave of the early Nordics pushed
westward along the sandy plains of the north and
pressed against and through the Alpine populations
of central Europe. Usually these early Nordics, as
indeed many of the later ones, constituted only a
thin layer of ruling classes and there must have
been many countries conquered by them in which
we have no historic evidence of their existence,
linguistic or otherwise. This must have certainly
been the case in those numerous instances where
only the leaders were Nordics and the great mass
of their followers slaves or serfs of inferior races.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>The Nordics also swept down through Thrace
into Greece and Asia Minor, while other large and
important groups entered Asia partly through the
Caucasus Mountains, but in greater strength they
migrated around the northern and eastern sides of
the Caspian-Aral Sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>That portion of the Nordic race which continued
to inhabit south Russia and grazed their flocks
of sheep and herds of horses on the grasslands
were the Scythians of the Greeks and from these
nomad shepherds came the Cimmerians, Persians,
Sacæ, Massagetæ and perhaps the leaders of the
Kassites, Mitanni and other early Aryan-speaking
Nordic invaders of Asia. The descendants of these
Nordics are scattered throughout Russia but are
now submerged by the later Slavs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Well marked characters of the Nordic race, which
were established in Neolithic times if not earlier,
enable us to distinguish it definitely wherever it
appears in history and we know that all the
blondness in the world is derived from this source.
As blondness is easily observed and recorded we
are apt to lay too much emphasis on this single
character. The brown shades of hair are equally
Nordic.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Nordics first enter the Mediterranean
world their arrival is everywhere marked by a
new and higher civilization. In most cases the
contact of the vigorous barbarians with the ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>civilizations created a sudden impulse of life and
an outburst of culture as soon as the first destruction
wrought by the conquest was repaired.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the long continued selection exercised
by severe climatic conditions and the consequent
elimination of ineffectives, both of which
affects a race, there is another force at work which
concerns the individual as well. The energy developed
in the north is not lost immediately when
transferred to the softer conditions of existence in
the Mediterranean and Indian countries. This energy
endures for several generations and only dies
away slowly as the northern blood becomes diluted
and the impulse to strive fades.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contact of Hellene and Pelasgian caused the
blossoming of the ancient civilization of Hellas,
just as two thousand years later when the Nordic
invaders of Italy had absorbed the science, art
and literature of Rome, they produced that splendid
century we call the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief men of the Cinque Cento and the
preceding century were of Nordic blood, largely
Gothic and Lombard, which is recognized easily by
a close inspection of busts or portraits in northern
Italy. Dante, Raphael, Titian, Michael Angelo,
Leonardo da Vinci were all of Nordic type, just as
in classic times many of the chief men and of the
upper classes were Nordic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar expansions of civilization and organization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of empire followed the incursion of the Nordic
Persians into the land of the round skulled Medes
and the introduction of Sanskrit into India by the
Nordic Sacæ who conquered that peninsula. These
outbursts of progress due to the first contact and
mixture of two contrasted races are, however, only
transitory and pass with the last lingering trace of
Nordic blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>In India the blood of these Aryan-speaking invaders
has been absorbed by the dark Hindu and in
the final event only their synthetic speech survives.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marvellous organization of the Roman state
made use of the services of Nordic mercenaries and
kept the Western Empire alive for three centuries
after the ancient Roman stock had virtually ceased
to exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The date when the population of the Empire had
become predominantly of Mediterranean and Oriental
blood, due to the introduction of slaves from
the east and the wastage of Italian blood in war,
coincides with the establishment of the Empire
under Augustus and the last Republican patriots
represent the final protest of the old patrician Nordic
strain. For the most part they refused to abdicate
their right to rule in favor of manumitted
slaves and imperial favorites and they fell in battle
and sword in hand. The Romans died out but the
slaves survived and their descendants form the
great majority of the south Italians of to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>In the last days of the Republic, Cæsar was the
leader of the mob, the Plebs, which by that time
had ceased to be of Roman blood. Pompey’s
party represented the remnants of the old native
Roman aristocracy and was defeated at Pharsalia
not by Cæsar’s plebeian clients but by his Nordic
legionaries from Gaul. Cassius and Brutus were
the last successors of Pompey and their overthrow
at Philippi was the final death blow to the Republican
party; with them the native Roman
families disappear almost entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decline of the Romans and for that matter
of the native Italians began with the Punic Wars
when in addition to the Romans who fell in battle
a large portion of the country population of Italy
was destroyed by Hannibal. Native Romans suffered
greatly in the Social and Servile Wars as well
as in the civil conflicts between the factions of
Sylla, who led the Patricians, and Marius who represented
the Plebs. Bloody proscriptions of the
rival parties followed alternately the victory of one
side and then of the other and under the tyranny
of the Emperors of the first century also the old
Roman stock was the greatest sufferer until it
practically vanished from the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>Voluntary childlessness was the most potent
cause of the decline under the Empire and when we
read of the abject servility of bearers of proud names
in the days of Nero and Caligula, we must remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>that they could not rally to their standard followers
among the Plebs. They had only the choice
of submission or suicide and many chose the latter
alternative. The abjectness of the Roman spirit
under the Empire is thus to be explained by a
change in race.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the expanding dominion of Rome the native
elements of vigor were drawn year after year
into the legions and spent their active years in
wars or in garrisons, while the slaves and those
unfit for military duty stayed home and bred. In
the present great war while the native Americans
are at the front fighting the aliens and immigrants
are allowed to increase without check and the parallel
is a close one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Slaves began to be imported into Italy in numbers
in the second century B. C. to work the large
plantations—latifundia—of the wealthy Romans.
This importation of slaves and the ultimate extension
of the Roman citizenship to their manumitted
descendants and to inferior races throughout the
growing Empire and the losses in internal and foreign
wars, ruined the state. In America we find another
close parallel in the Civil War and the subsequent
granting of citizenship to Negroes and to
ever increasing numbers of immigrants of plebeian,
servile or Oriental races, who throughout history
have shown little capacity to create, organize or
even to comprehend Republican institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>In Rome, when this change in blood was substantially
complete, the state could no longer be
operated under Republican forms of government
and the Empire arose to take its place. At the
beginning the Empire was clothed in the garb of
republicanism in deference to such Roman elements
as still persisted in the Senate and among the
Patricians but ultimately these external forms were
discarded and the state became virtually a pure
despotism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new population understood little and cared
less for the institutions of the ancient Republic
but they were jealous of their own rights of “Bread
and the Circus”—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">panem et circenses</span>”—and there
began to appear in place of the old Roman religion
the mystic rites of Eastern countries so welcome to
the plebeian and uneducated soul. The Emperors
to please the vulgar erected from time to time new
shrines to strange gods utterly unknown to the
Romans of the early Republic. In America, also,
strange temples, which would have been abhorrent
to our Colonial ancestors, are multiplying and our
streets and parks are turned over to monuments to
foreign “patriots,” designed not to please the artistic
sense of the passer-by but to gratify the national
preference of some alien element in the electorate.</p>

<p class='c007'>These comments on the change of race in Rome
at the beginning of our era are not mere speculation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>An examination of many thousands of Roman columbaria
or funeral urns and the names inscribed
thereon show quite clearly that as early as the first
century of our era eighty to ninety per cent of
the urban population of the Roman Empire was of
servile extraction and that about seven-eighths
of this slave population was drawn from districts
within the boundaries of the Empire and very
largely from the countries bordering on the eastern
Mediterranean. Few names are found which indicate
that their bearers came from Gaul or the
countries beyond the Alps. These Nordic barbarians
were of more use in the legions than as household
servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the Christian era the entire
Levant and countries adjoining it in Asia Minor,
Syria and Egypt had been so thoroughly hellenized
that many of their inhabitants bore Greek names.
It was from these countries and from northern
Africa that the slave population of Rome was
drawn. Their descendants were the most important
element in the Roman melting pot and
even to-day form the predominant element in the
population of Italy south of the Apennines. When
the Nordic barbarians a few centuries later poured
in, these Romanized Orientals disappeared temporarily
from view under the rule of the vigorous
northerners but they have steadily absorbed the
latter until the Nordic elements in Italy now are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>to be found chiefly in the Lombard plains and the
region of the Alps.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Byzantine Empire from much the same
causes as the Roman became in its turn gradually
less and less European and more and more Oriental
until it, too, withered and expired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarded in the light of the facts the fall of
Rome ceases to be a mystery. The wonder is that
the State lived on after the Romans were extinct
and that the Eastern Empire survived so long with
an ever fading Greek population. In Rome and in
Greece only the language of the dominant race survived.</p>

<p class='c007'>So entirely had the blood of the Romans vanished
in the last days of the Empire that sorry
bands of barbarians wandered at will through the
desolated provinces. Cæsar and his legions would
have made short work of these unorganized banditti
but Cæsar’s legions were a memory, though
one great enough to inspire in the intruders somewhat
of awe and desire to imitate. Against invaders,
however, brains and brawn are more effective
than tradition and culture, however noble
these last may be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early ascetic Christianity played a large part in
this decline of the Roman Empire as it was at the
outset the religion of the slave, the meek and the
lowly while Stoicism was the religion of the strong
men of the time. This bias in favor of the weaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>elements greatly interfered with their elimination
by natural processes and the fighting force of the
Empire was gradually undermined. Christianity
was in sharp contrast to the worship of tribal
deities which preceded it and it tended then as
now to break down class and race distinctions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The maintenance of such distinctions is absolutely
essential to race purity in any community
when two or more races live side by side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Race feeling may be called prejudice by those
whose careers are cramped by it but it is a natural
antipathy which serves to maintain the purity of
type. The unfortunate fact that nearly all species
of men interbreed freely leaves us no choice in the
matter. Races must be kept apart by artificial
devices of this sort or they ultimately amalgamate
and in the offspring the more generalized or lower
type prevails.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>X<br /> <span class='large'>THE NORDIC RACE OUTSIDE OF EUROPE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We find few traces of Nordic characters outside
of Europe. When Egypt was invaded by the Libyans
from the west in 1230 B. C. they were accompanied
by “sea peoples,” probably the Achæan
Greeks. There is some evidence of blondness
among the people of the south shore of the Mediterranean
down to Greek times and the Tamahu
or fair Libyans are constantly mentioned in Egyptian
records. The reddish blond or partly blond
Berbers found to-day on the northern slopes of the
Atlas Mountains may well be their descendants.
That this blondness of the Berbers, though small
in amount, is of Nordic origin we may with safety
assume, but through what channels it came we
have no means of knowing. There is no historic
invasion of north Africa by Nordics except the
Vandal conquests but there seems to be little
probability that this small Teutonic tribe left behind
any physical trace in the native population.</p>

<p class='c007'>There seem to have been traces of Nordic blood
among the Philistines and still more among the
Amorites. Certain references to the size of the sons
of Anak and to the fairness of David, whose mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>was an Amoritish woman, point vaguely in this direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>References in Chinese annals to the green eyes of
the Wu-suns or to the Hiung-Nu in central Asia are
almost the only evidence we have of the Nordic race
in contact with the peoples of eastern Asia, though
there are statements in ancient Chinese or Mongolian
records as to the existence of blond and
tall tribes and nations in those parts of northern
Asia where Mongols are now found exclusively.
We may expect to acquire much new light on this
subject during the next few decades.</p>

<p class='c007'>The so-called blondness of the hairy Ainus of the
northern islands of Japan seems to be due to a trace
of what might be called Proto-Nordic blood. In
hairiness these people are in sharp contrast with
their Mongoloid neighbors but this is a generalized
character common to the highest and the lowest
races of man. The primitive Australoids and
the highly specialized Scandinavians are among
the most hairy populations in the world. So in the
Ainus this somatological peculiarity is merely the
retention of a primitive trait. The occasional
brown or greenish eye and the sometimes fair complexion
of the Ainus are, however, suggestive of
Nordic affinities and of an extreme easterly extension
of Proto-Nordics at a very early period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skull shape of the Ainus is dolichocephalic or
mesaticephalic, while the broad cheek bones indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>a Mongolian cross as among the Esquimaux.
The Ainus, like many other small, mysterious
peoples, are probably merely the remnants of one
of the early races that are fast fading into extinction.
The division of man into species and subspecies
is very ancient and the chief races of the
earth are the successful survivors of a long and
fierce competition. Many species, subspecies and
races have vanished utterly, except for reversional
characters occasionally found in the larger races.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only Nordics in Asia Minor, so far as we
know, were the Phrygians who crossed the Hellespont
about 1400 B. C. as part of the same migration
which brought the Achæans into Greece, the
Cimmerians who entered by the same route and
also through the Caucasus about 650 B. C. and
still later, in 270 B. C., the Gauls who, coming from
northern Italy through Thrace, founded Galatia.
So far as our present information goes little or no
trace of these invasions remains in the existing
populations of Anatolia. The expansions of the
Persians and the Aryanization of their empire and
the conquests of the Nordics east and south of the
Caspian-Aral Sea, will be discussed in connection
with the spread of Aryan languages.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>XI<br /> <span class='large'>RACIAL APTITUDES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Such are the three races, the Alpine, the Mediterranean
and the Nordic, which enter into the
composition of European populations of to-day and
in various combinations comprise the great bulk of
white men all over the world. These races vary
intellectually and morally just as they do physically.
Moral, intellectual and spiritual attributes are as
persistent as physical characters and are transmitted
substantially unchanged from generation to
generation. These moral and physical characters
are not limited to one race but given traits do
occur with more frequency in one race than in another.
Each race differs in the relative proportion
of what we may term good and bad strains, just as
nations do, or, for that matter, sections and classes
of the same nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In considering skull characters we must remember
that, while indicative of independent descent,
the size and shape of the head are not closely related
to brain power. Aristotle was a Mediterranean
if we may trust the authenticity of his busts
and had a small, long skull, while Humboldt’s
large and characteristically Nordic skull was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>equally dolichocephalic. Socrates and Diogenes
were apparently quite un-Greek and represent remnants
of some early race, perhaps of Paleolithic man.
The history of their lives indicates that each was
recognized by his fellow countrymen as in some
degree alien, just as the Jews apparently regarded
Christ as, in some indefinite way, non-Jewish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mental, spiritual and moral traits are closely associated
with the physical distinctions among the
different European races, although like somatological
characters, these spiritual attributes have in
many cases gone astray. Enough remain, however,
to show that certain races have special aptitudes
for certain pursuits.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpine race is always and everywhere a race
of peasants, an agricultural and never a maritime
race. In fact they only extend to salt water at the
head of the Adriatic and, like all purely agricultural
communities throughout Europe, tend toward
democracy, although they are submissive to authority
both political and religious being usually
Roman Catholics in western Europe. This race is
essentially of the soil and in towns the type is
mediocre and bourgeois.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coastal and seafaring populations of northern
Europe are everywhere Nordic as far as the
shores of Spain and among Europeans this race is
pre-eminently fitted for maritime pursuits. Enterprise
at sea during the Middle Ages was in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>hands of Mediterraneans just as it was originally
developed by Cretans, Phœnicians and Carthaginians
but after the Reformation the Nordics seized
and occupied this field almost exclusively.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordics are, all over the world, a race of
soldiers, sailors, adventurers and explorers, but
above all, of rulers, organizers and aristocrats in
sharp contrast to the essentially peasant and democratic
character of the Alpines. The Nordic race
is domineering, individualistic, self-reliant and jealous
of their personal freedom both in political and
religious systems and as a result they are usually
Protestants. Chivalry and knighthood and their
still surviving but greatly impaired counterparts
are peculiarly Nordic traits, and feudalism, class
distinctions and race pride among Europeans are
traceable for the most part to the north.</p>

<p class='c007'>The social status of woman varies largely with
race but here religion plays a part. In the Roman
Republic and in ancient Germany women were held
in high esteem. In the Nordic countries of to-day
women’s rights have received much more recognition
than among the southern nations with their
traditions of Latin culture. To this general statement
modern Germany is a marked exception.
The contrast is great between the mental attitude
toward woman of the ancient Teutons and that of
the modern Germans.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pure Nordic peoples are characterized by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>greater stability and steadiness than are mixed peoples
such as the Irish, the ancient Gauls and the
Athenians among all of whom the lack of these
qualities was balanced by a correspondingly greater
versatility.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mental characteristics of the Mediterranean
race are well known and this race, while inferior in
bodily stamina to both the Nordic and the Alpine,
is probably the superior of both, certainly of the Alpines,
in intellectual attainments. In the field of art
its superiority to both the other European races is
unquestioned, although in literature and in scientific
research and discovery the Nordics far excel it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving this interesting subject of the
correlation of spiritual and moral traits with physical
characters we may note that these influences
are so deeply rooted in everyday consciousness
that the modern novelist or playwright does not
fail to make his hero a tall, blond, honest and
somewhat stupid youth and his villain a small, dark
and exceptionally intelligent individual of warped
moral character. So in Celtic legend as in the
Græco-Roman and mediæval romances, prince and
princess are always fair, a fact rather indicating
that the mass of the people were brunet at the
time when the legends were taking shape. In
fact, “fair” is a synonym for beauty. Most ancient
tapestries show a blond earl on horseback
and a dark-haired churl holding the bridle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>The gods of Olympus were almost all described as
blond, and it would be difficult to imagine a Greek
artist painting a brunet Venus. In church pictures
all angels are blond, while the denizens of the
lower regions revel in deep brunetness. “Non Angli
sed angeli,” remarked Pope Gregory when he first
saw Saxon children exposed for sale in the Roman
slave-mart.</p>

<p class='c007'>In depicting the crucifixion no artist hesitates to
make the two thieves brunet in contrast to the
blond Saviour. This is something more than a
convention, as such quasi-authentic traditions as
we have of our Lord strongly suggest his Nordic,
possibly Greek, physical and moral attributes.</p>

<p class='c007'>These and similar traditions clearly point to the
relations of the one race to the other in classic,
mediæval and modern times. How far they may
be modified by democratic institutions and the rule
of the majority remains to be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wars of the past two thousand years in Europe
have been almost exclusively wars between
the various nations of this race or between rulers
of Nordic blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a race point of view the present European
conflict is essentially a civil war and nearly all the
officers and a large proportion of the men on both
sides are members of this race. It is the same old
tragedy of mutual butchery and mutual destruction
between Nordics, just as the Nordic nobility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>of Renaissance Italy seems to have been possessed
with a blood mania to murder one another. It is
the modern edition of the old Berserker blood rage
and is class suicide on a gigantic scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the war it was difficult to
say on which side there was the preponderance of
Nordic blood. Flanders and northern France are
more Nordic than south Germany, while the backbone
of the armies that England put into the field
as well as of those of her colonies was almost
purely Nordic and a large proportion of the Russian
army was of the same race. As heretofore
stated, with America in the war, the greater part
of the Nordics of the world are fighting against
Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the writer has limited carefully the
use of the word “Teutonic” to that section of the
Nordic race which originated in Scandinavia and
which later spread over northern Europe, nevertheless
this term is unfortunate because it is currently
given a national and not a racial meaning
and is used to denote the populations of the central
empires. This popular use includes millions
who are un-Teutonic and excludes millions of pure
Teutonic blood who are outside of the political
borders of Austria and Germany and who are bitterly
hostile to the very name itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The present inhabitants of the German Empire,
to say nothing of Austria, are only to a limited extent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>descendants of the ancient Teutonic tribes,
being very largely Alpines, especially in the east
and south. To abandon to the Germans and
Austrians the exclusive right to the name Teuton
or Teutonic would be to acquiesce in one of their
most grandiose pretensions.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>XII<br /> <span class='large'>ARYA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Having shown the existence in Europe of three
distinct subspecies of man and a single predominant
group of languages called the Aryan or synthetic
group, it remains to inquire to which of the
three races can be assigned the honor of inventing,
elaborating and introducing this most highly developed
form of human speech. Our investigations
will show that the facts point indubitably
to an original unity between the Nordic or rather
the Proto-Nordic race and the Proto-Aryan language
or the generalized, ancestral, Aryan mother
tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the three claimants to the honor of being the
original creator of the Aryan group of languages,
we can at once dismiss the Mediterranean race.
The members of this subspecies on the south
shores of the Mediterranean, the Berbers and the
Egyptians, and many peoples in western Asia speak
now and have always spoken Anaryan tongues.
We also know that the speech of the original Pelasgians
was not Aryan, that in Crete remnants of
Pre-Aryan speech persisted until about 500 B. C.
and that the Hellenic language was introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>into Ægean countries from the north. In Italy the
Etruscan in the north and the Messapian in the
south were Anaryan languages and the ancestral
form of Latin speech in the guise of Umbrian and
Oscan came through the Alps from the countries
beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Spain a Celtic language was introduced from
the north about 500 B. C. but with so little force
behind it that it was unable to replace entirely
the Anaryan Basque language of at least a portion
of the aborigines.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Britain, Aryan speech was introduced about
800 B. C. and in France somewhat earlier. In central
and northern Europe no certain trace of the
Anaryan languages at one time spoken there persists,
except among the Lapps and in the neighborhood
of the Gulf of Finland, where Non-Aryan
Finnic dialects are spoken to-day by the Finlanders
and the Esthonians.</p>

<p class='c007'>We thus know the approximate dates of the introduction
of Aryan speech into western and southern
Europe and that it came in through the medium
of the Nordic race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Spain and in the adjoining parts of France
nearly half a million people continue to speak an
agglutinative language, called Basque or Euskarian.
In skull shape these Basques correspond
closely with the Aryan-speaking populations around
them, being dolichocephalic in Spain and brachycephalic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>or pseudo-brachycephalic in France. In
the case of both the long skulled and the round
skulled Basques the lower part of the face is long
and thin, with a peculiar and pointed chin and
among the French Basques the skull is broadened
in the temporal region. In other words, their faces
show certain secondary racial characters which have
been imposed by selection upon a people composed
originally of two races of independent origin, but
long isolated by the limitations of language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Euskarian language is believed to have been
related to the ancient Iberian but has affinities
which point to Asia as its place of origin and make
possible the hypothesis that it may have been derived
from the ancient language of the Proto-Alpines
in the west.</p>

<p class='c007'>The problem of the extinct Ligurian language
must be considered in this connection. It seems to
have been Anaryan, but we do not know whether
it was the speech originally of Alpines or of Mediterraneans
either of whom could be reasonably
considered as a claimant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other than the Basque language there are in
western Europe but few remains of Pre-Aryan
speech, and these are found chiefly in place names
and in a few obscure words.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remnants of Anaryan speech exist here and there
throughout European Russia, but many of them
can be traced to historic invasions. Until we reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the main body of Ural-Altaic speech in the east of
Russia, the Esthonians, with kindred tribes of Livonians
and Tchouds, and the Finns are the only
peoples who speak Non-Aryan tongues, but the
physical type with the exception of the skull shape
of all these tribes is distinctly Nordic. In this connection
the Lapps and related groups in the far
north can be disregarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The problem of the Finns is a difficult one. The
coast of Finland, of course, is purely Swedish, but
the great bulk of the population in the interior is
brachycephalic, though otherwise thoroughly Nordic
in type.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Anaryan Finnish, Esthonian and Livonian
languages were probably introduced at the same
time as were round skulls into Finland. The
shores of the Gulf of Finland were originally inhabited
by Nordics and the intrusion of round
skulled Finns probably came soon after the Christian
era. This immigration and that of the Livonians
and Esthonians may possibly have been part
of the same movement which brought the Alpine
Wends into eastern Germany. The earliest references
to the Finns that we have locate them in
central Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important Anaryan language in Europe
is the Magyar of Hungary, but this we know was introduced
from the eastward at the end of the ninth
century, as was the earlier but now extinct Avar.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>In the Balkans the language of the Turks has
never been a vernacular as it is in Asia Minor. In
Europe it was spoken only by the soldiers and the
civil administrators and by very sparse colonies
of Turkish settlers. The mania of the Turks for
white women, which is said to have been one of the
motives that led to the conquest of the Byzantine
Empire, has unconsciously resulted in the obliteration
of the Mongoloid type of the original Asiatic
invaders. Persistent crossing with Circassian and
Georgian women, as well as with slaves of every
race in Asia Minor and in Europe with whom they
came in contact, has made the European Turk
of to-day indistinguishable in physical characters
from his Christian neighbors. At the same time,
polygamy has greatly strengthened the hold of the
dominant Turk. In fact, among the upper classes
of the higher races monogamy and the resultant
limitation in number of offspring has been a source
of weakness from the viewpoint of race expansion.
The Turks of Seljukian and Osmanli origin were
never numerous and the Sultan’s armies were
largely composed of Islamized Anatolians and Europeans.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Persia and India, also, the Aryan languages
were introduced from the north at known periods,
so in view of all these facts the Mediterranean
race cannot claim the honor of either the invention
or dissemination of the synthetic languages.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>The chief claim of the Alpine race of central Europe
and western Asia to the invention and introduction
into Europe of the Proto-Aryan form of
speech rests on the fact that nearly all the members
of this race in Europe speak well developed Aryan
languages, chiefly in some form of Slavic. This
fact taken by itself may have no more significance
than the fact that the Mediterranean race in
Spain, Italy and France speaks Romance languages,
but it is, nevertheless, an argument of some
weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Outside of Europe the Armenians and other
Armenoid brachycephalic peoples of Asia Minor
and the Iranian Highlands, all of Alpine race, together
with a few isolated tribes of the Caucasus,
speak Aryan languages and these peoples lie on
the highroad along which knowledge of the metals
and other cultural developments entered Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the Aryan language were invented and developed
by these Armenoid Alpines we should be
obliged to assume that they introduced it along
with bronze culture into Europe about 3000 B. C.
and taught the Nordics both their language and
their metal culture. There are, however, in western
Asia many Alpine peoples who do not speak
Aryan languages and yet are Alpine in type, such
as the Turcomans and in Asia Minor the so-called
Turks are also largely Islamized Alpines of
the Armenoid subspecies who speak Turki. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>is no trace of Aryan speech south of the Caucasus
until after 1700 B. C. and the Hittite language
spoken before that date in central and eastern
Asia Minor, although not yet clearly deciphered,
was Anaryan to the best of our present knowledge.
The Hittites themselves were probably ancestral
to the living Armenians.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are sufficiently acquainted with the languages
of the ancient Mesopotamian countries to know
that the speech of Accad and Sumer, of Susa and
Media was agglutinative and that the languages of
Assyria and of Palestine were Semitic. The speech
of the Kassites was Anaryan, but they seem to have
been in contact with the horse-using Nordics and
some of their leaders bore Aryan names. The
language of the shortlived empire of the Mitanni
in the foothills south of Armenia is the only one
about the character of which there can be serious
doubt. There is, therefore, much negative evidence
against the existence of Aryan speech in that part
of the world earlier than its known introduction
by Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, then, the last great expansion into Europe of
the Alpine race brought from Asia the Aryan
mother tongue, as well as the knowledge of metals,
we must assume that all the members of the Nordic
race thereupon adopted synthetic speech from
the Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that these Alpines reached Britain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>about 1800 B. C. and probably they had previously
occupied much of Gaul, so that if they are to be
credited with the introduction of the synthetic
languages into western Europe, it is difficult to
understand why we have no known trace of
any form of Aryan speech in central Europe or
west of the Rhine prior to 1000 B. C. while we
have some, though scanty, evidence of Non-Aryan
languages.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be said in favor of this claim of the Alpine
race to be the original inventor of synthetic
speech, that language is ever a measure of culture
and the higher forms of civilization are greatly
hampered by the limitations of speech imposed
by the less highly evolved languages, namely, the
monosyllabic and the agglutinative, which include
nearly all the Non-Aryan languages of the world.
It does not seem probable that barbarians, however
fine in physical type and however well endowed
with the potentiality of intellectual and
moral development, dwelling as hunters in the
bleak and barren north along the edge of the retreating
glaciers and as nomad shepherds in the
Russian grasslands, could have evolved a more
complicated and higher form of articulate speech
than the inhabitants of southwestern Asia, who
many thousand years earlier were highly civilized
and are known to have invented the arts of agriculture,
metal working and domestication of animals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>as well as of writing and pottery. Nevertheless,
such seems to be the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>To summarize, it appears that a study of the
Mediterranean race shows that so far from being
purely European, it is equally African and Asiatic
and that in the narrow coastal fringe of southern
Persia, in India and even farther east the last
strains of this race gradually fade into the Negroids
through prolonged cross breeding. A similar inquiry
into the origin and distribution of the Alpine
subspecies shows clearly the fundamentally Asiatic
origin of the type and that on its easternmost
borders in central Asia it marches with the round
skulled Mongols, and that neither the one nor the
other was the inventor of Aryan speech.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>XIII<br /> <span class='large'>ORIGIN OF THE ARYAN LANGUAGES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By the process of elimination set forth in the preceding
chapter we are competed to acknowledge
that the strongest claimant for the honor of being
the race of the original Aryans, is the tall, blond
Nordic. An analysis of the various languages of
the Aryan group reveals an extreme diversity which
can be best explained by the hypothesis that the
existing languages are now spoken by people upon
whom Aryan speech has been forced from without.
This theory corresponds exactly with the
known historic fact that the Aryan languages, during
the last three or four thousand years at least
have, again and again, been imposed by Nordics
upon populations of Alpine and Mediterranean
blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within the present distributional area of the
Nordic race on the Gulf of Riga and in the very
middle of a typical area of isolation, are the most
generalized members of the Aryan group, namely
Lettish and Lithuanian, both almost Proto-Aryan
in character. Close at hand existed the closely
related Old Prussian or Borussian, very recently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>extinct. These archaic languages are relatively
close to Sanskrit and exist in actual contact with
the Anaryan speech of the Esthonians and Finns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Anaryan languages in eastern Russia are
Ugrian, a form of speech which extends far into
Asia and which appears to contain elements which
unite it with synthetic speech and may be dimly
transitory in character. In the opinion of many
philologists, a primitive form of Ugrian might have
given birth to the Proto-Aryan ancestor of existing
synthetic languages.</p>

<p class='c007'>This hypothesis, if sustained by further study,
will provide additional evidence that the site of
the development of the Aryan languages and of
the Nordic subspecies was in eastern Europe,
in a region which is close to the meeting place between
the most archaic synthetic languages and
the most nearly related Anaryan tongue, the agglutinative
Ugrian.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Aryan tongue was introduced into Greece
by the Achæans about 1400 B. C. and later, about
1100 B. C. by the true Hellenes, who brought in
the classic dialects of Dorian, Ionian and Æolian.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Aryan languages superseded their Anaryan
predecessor, the Pelasgian. From the language
of these early invaders came the Illyrian,
Thracian, Albanian, classic Greek and the debased
modern Romaic, a descendant of the Ionian dialect.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Aryan speech was introduced among the Anaryan-speaking
Etruscans of the Italian Peninsula
by the Umbrians and Oscans about 1100 B. C.
and from the language of these conquerors was derived
Latin which later spread to the uttermost
confines of the Roman Empire. Its descendants
to-day are the Romance tongues spoken within
the ancient imperial boundaries, Portuguese on the
west, Castilian, Catalan, Provençal, French, the
Langue d’oïl of the Walloons, Romansch, Ladin,
Friulian, Tuscan, Calabrian and Rumanian.</p>

<p class='c007'>The problem of the existence of a language
clearly descended from Latin, the Rumanian, in the
eastern Carpathians cut off by Slavic and Magyar
tongues from the nearest Romance tongues presents
difficulties. The Rumanians themselves make two
claims; the first, which can be safely disregarded,
is an unbroken linguistic descent from a group of
Aryan languages which occupied this whole section
of Europe, from which Latin was derived and of
which Albanian is also a remnant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more serious claim, however, made by the
Rumanians is to linguistic and racial descent from
the military colonists planted by the Emperor
Trajan in the great Dacian plain north of the
Danube. This may be possible, so far as the language
is concerned, but there are some weighty objections
to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have little evidence for, and much against, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>existence of Rumanian speech north of the Danube
for nearly a thousand years after Rome abandoned
this outlying region. Dacia was one of the last
provinces to be occupied by Rome and was the
first from which the legions were withdrawn upon
the decline of the Empire. The northern Carpathians,
furthermore, where the Rumanians claim
to have taken refuge during the barbarian invasions
formed part of the Slavic homeland and it
was in these same mountains and in the Ruthenian
districts of eastern Galicia that the Slavic languages
were developed, probably by the Sarmatians
and Venethi, from whence they spread in all directions
in the centuries that immediately followed
the fall of Rome. So it is almost impossible to
credit the survival of a frontier community of
Romanized natives situated not only in the path
of the great invasions of Europe from the east,
but also in the very spot where Slavic tongues
were at the time evolving.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rumanian speech occupies large areas outside
of the present kingdom of Rumania, in Russian
Bessarabia, Austrian Bukowina and above all in
Hungarian Transylvania.</p>

<p class='c007'>The linguistic problem is further complicated
by the existence in the Pindus Mountains of Thessaly
of another large community of Vlachs of Rumanian
speech. How this later community could
have survived from Roman times until to-day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>untouched either by the Greek language of the
Byzantine Empire or by the Turkish conquest is
another difficult problem.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence, on the whole, points to the descent
of the Vlachs from the early inhabitants of Thrace,
who adopted Latin speech in the first centuries of
the Christian era and clung to it during the domination
of the Bulgarians from the seventh century
onward in the lands south of the Danube. In
the thirteenth century the mass of these Vlachs,
leaving scattered remnants behind them, crossed
the Danube and founded Little and Great Wallachia.
From there they spread into Transylvania
and a century later into Moldavia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The solution of this problem receives no assistance
from anthropology, as these Rumanian-speaking
populations both on the Danube and in
the Pindus Mountains in no way differ physically
from their neighbors on all sides. But through
whatever channel they acquired their Latin speech
the Rumanians of to-day can lay no valid claim to
blood descent even in a remote degree from the
true Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first Aryan languages known in western
Europe were the Celtic group which first appears
west of the Rhine about 1000 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only a few dim traces of Pre-Aryan speech have
been found in the British Isles, and these largely
in place names. The Pre-Aryan language of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Pre-Nordic population of Britain may have survived
down to historic times as Pictish.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Britain, Celtic speech was introduced in two
successive waves, first by the Goidels or “Q” Celts,
who apparently appeared about 800 B. C. and this
form exists to this day as Erse in western Ireland,
as Manx of the Isle of Man and as Gaelic in the
Scottish Highlands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Goidels were still in a state of bronze culture.
When they reached Britain they must have
found there a population preponderantly of Mediterranean
type with numerous remains of still earlier
races of Paleolithic times and also some round
skulled Alpines of the Round Barrows, who have
since largely faded from the living population.
When the next invasion, the Cymric or Brythonic,
occurred the Goidels had been absorbed very largely
by the underlying Mediterranean aborigines who
had meanwhile accepted the Goidelic form of Celtic
speech, just as on the continent the Gauls had
mixed with Alpine and Mediterranean natives and
had imposed upon the conquered their own tongue.
In fact, in Britain, Gaul and Spain the Goidels and
Gauls were chiefly a ruling, military class, while the
great bulk of the population remained unchanged
although Aryanized in speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Brythonic or Cymric tribes or “P” Celts
followed the “Q” Celts four or five hundred years
later, and drove the Goidels westward through Germany,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Gaul and Britain and this movement of
population was still going on when Cæsar crossed
the Channel. The Brythonic group gave rise to
the modern Cornish, extinct within a century, the
Cymric of Wales and the Armorican of Brittany.</p>

<p class='c007'>In central Europe we find traces of these same
two forms of Celtic speech with the Goidelic everywhere
the older and the Cymric the more recent
arrival. The cleavage between the dialects of the
“Q” Celts and the “P” Celts was probably less
marked two thousand years ago than at present,
since in their modern form they are both Neo-Celtic
languages. What vestiges of Celtic languages remain
in France belong to Brythonic. Celtic was
not generally spoken in Aquitaine in Cæsar’s time.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the two Celtic-speaking races came into
conflict in Britain their original relationship had
been greatly obscured by the crossing of the Goidels
with the underlying dark Mediterranean race
of Neolithic culture and by the mixture of the
Belgæ with Teutonic tribes. The result was that
the Brythons did not distinguish between the blond
Goidels and the brunet but Celticized Mediterraneans
as they all spoke Goidelic dialects.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same way when the Saxons and the Angles
entered Britain they found there a population
speaking Celtic of some form, either Goidelic or
Cymric and promptly called them all Welsh (foreigners).
These Welsh were preponderantly of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Mediterranean type with some mixture of a blond
Goidel strain and a much stronger blond strain of
Cymric origin and these same elements exist to-day
in England. The Mediterranean race is easily distinguished,
but the physical types derived from
Goidel and Brython alike are merged and lost in
the later floods of pure Nordic blood, Angle, Saxon,
Dane, Norse and Norman. In this primitive,
dark population with successive layers of blond
Nordics imposed upon it, each one more purely
Nordic and in the relative absence of round heads
lie the secret and the solution of the anthropology
of the British Isles. This Iberian substratum was
able to absorb to a large extent the earlier Celtic-speaking
invaders, both Goidels and Brythons,
but it is only just beginning to seriously threaten
the later Nordics and to reassert its ancient brunet
characters after three thousand years of submergence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In northwest Scotland there is a Gaelic-speaking
area where the place names are all Scandinavian
and the physical types purely Nordic. This is
the only spot in the British Isles where Celtic
speech has reconquered a district from the Teutonic
languages and it was the site of one of the
conquests of the Norse Vikings, probably in the
early centuries of the Christian era. In Caithness
in north Scotland, as well as in some isolated
spots on the Irish coasts, the language of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>same Norse pirates persisted within a century. In
the fifth century of our era and after the break-up
of Roman domination in Britain there was much
racial unrest and a back wave of Goidels crossed
from Ireland and either reintroduced or reinforced
the Gaelic speech in the highlands. Later, Goidelic
speech was gradually driven northward and westward
by the intrusive English of the lowlands and
was ultimately forced over this originally Norse-speaking
area. We have elsewhere in Europe evidence
of similar shiftings of speech without any
corresponding change in the blood of the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>Except in the British Isles and in Brittany Celtic
languages have left no modern descendants, but
have everywhere been replaced by languages of Neo-Latin
or of Teutonic origin. Outside of Brittany
one of the last, if not quite the last, reference to
Celtic speech in Gaul is the historic statement
that “Celtic” tribes, as well as “Armoricans,” took
part at Châlons in the great victory in 451 A. D.
over Attila the Hun and his confederacy of subject
nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the continent the only existing populations
of Celtic speech are the primitive inhabitants of
central Brittany, a population noted for their religious
fanaticism and for other characteristics of a
backward people. This Celtic speech is claimed to
have been introduced about 450–500 A. D. by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Britons fleeing from the Saxons. These refugees,
if there were any substantial number of them, must
have been dolichocephs of either Mediterranean or
Nordic race or both. We are asked by this tradition
to believe that their long skull was lost, but
that their language was adopted by the round
skulled Alpine population of Armorica. It is much
more probable that the Cymric-speaking Alpines
of Brittany have merely retained in this isolated
corner of France a form of Celtic speech which was
prevalent throughout northern Gaul and Britain
before these provinces were conquered by Rome
and Latinized and which, perhaps, was reinforced
later by British Cymry. Cæsar remarked that
there was little difference between the speech of the
Belgæ in northern Gaul and in Britain. In both
cases the speech was Cymric.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long after the conquest of Gaul by the Goths
and Franks Teutonic speech remained predominant
among the ruling classes and, by the time it succumbed
to the Latin tongue of the Romanized natives,
the old Celtic languages had been entirely
forgotten outside of Brittany.</p>

<p class='c007'>An example of similar changes of language is
to be found in Normandy where the country was
inhabited by the Nordic Belgæ speaking a Cymric
language before that tongue was replaced by Latin.
This coast was ravaged about 300 or 400 A. D. by
Saxons who formed settlements along both sides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of the Channel and the coasts of Brittany which
were later known as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Litus Saxonicum</span>. Their
progress can best be traced by place names as our
historic record of these raids is scanty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Normans landed in Normandy in the year
911 A. D. They were heathen, Danish barbarians,
speaking a Teutonic tongue. The religion, culture
and language of the old Romanized populations
worked a miracle in the transformation of everything
except blood in one short century. So quick
was the change that 155 years later the descendants
of the same Normans landed in England as
Christian Frenchmen armed with all the culture of
their period. The change was startling, but the
Norman blood remained unchanged and entered
England as a substantially Nordic type.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>XIV<br /> <span class='large'>THE ARYAN LANGUAGE IN ASIA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the Ægean region and south of the Caucasus
Nordics appear after 1700 B. C. but there were
unquestionably invasions and raids from the
north for many centuries previous to our first
records. These early migrations were probably
not in sufficient force to modify the blood of the
autochthonous races or to substitute Aryan languages
for the ancient Mediterranean and Asiatic
tongues.</p>

<p class='c007'>These men of the North came from the grasslands
of Russia in successive waves and among
the first of whom we have fairly clear knowledge
were the Achæans and Phrygians. Aryan names
are mentioned in the dim chronicles of the Mesopotamian
empires about 1700 B. C. among the
Kassites and later, Mitanni. Aryan names of
prisoners captured beyond the mountains in the
north and of Aryan deities before whom oaths
were taken are recorded about 1400 B. C. but one
of the first definite accounts of Nordics south of the
Caucasus describes the presence of Nordic Persians
at Lake Urmia about 900 B. C. There were many
incursions from that time on, the Cimmerians raiding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>across the Caucasus as early as 650 B. C. and
shortly afterward overrunning all Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The easterly extension of the Russian steppes or
Kiptchak north of the Caspian-Aral Sea in Turkestan
as far as the foothills of the Pamirs was occupied
by the Sacæ or Massagetæ, who were also
Nordics and akin to the Cimmerians and Persians,
as were, perhaps, the Ephtalites or White Huns in
Sogdiana north of Persia, destroyed by the Turks
in the sixth century.</p>

<p class='c007'>For several centuries groups of Nordics drifted
as nomad shepherds across the Caucasus into the
empire of the Medes, introducing little by little
the Aryan tongue which later developed into Old
Persian. By 550 B. C. these Persians had become
sufficiently numerous to overthrow their rulers and
under the leadership of the great Cyrus they organized
the Persian Empire, one of the most enduring of
Oriental states. The base of the population of the
Persian Empire rested on the round skulled Medes
who belonged to the Armenoid subdivision of the
Alpines. Under the leadership of their priestly
caste of Magi these Medes rebelled again and again
against their Nordic masters before the two peoples
became fused.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 525 to 485 B. C. during the reign of
Darius, whose sculptured portraits show a man of
pure Nordic type, the tall, blond Persians had become
almost exclusively a class of great ruling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>nobles and had forgotten the simplicity of their
shepherd ancestors. Their language belonged to
the Eastern or Iranian division of Aryan speech
and was known as Old Persian, which continued
to be spoken until the fourth century before the
Christian era. From it were derived Pehlevi, or
Parthian as well as modern Persian. The great
book of the old Persians, the Avesta, which was
written in Zendic, also an Iranian language, does
not go back to the reign of Darius and was remodelled
after the Christian era, but the Old Persian
of Darius was closely related to the Zendic of
Bactria and to the Sanskrit of Hindustan. From
Zendic, also called Medic, are derived Ghalcha,
Balochi, Kurdish and other dialects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rise to imperial power of the dolichocephalic
Aryan-speaking Persians was largely due to the
genius of their leaders but the Aryanization of
western Asia by them is one of the most amazing
events in history. The whole region became completely
transformed so far as the acceptance by the
conquered of the language and religion of the Persians
was concerned, but the blood of the Nordic
race quickly became diluted and a few centuries
later disappears from history.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the great wars with Greece the pure
Persian blood was still unimpaired and in control.
In the literature of the time there is little
evidence of race antagonism between the Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>and the Persian leaders although their rival cultures
were sharply contrasted. In the time of
Alexander the Great the pure Persian blood was
obviously confined to the nobles and it was the
policy of Alexander to Hellenize the Persians and
to amalgamate his Greeks with them. The amount
of pure Macedonian blood was not sufficient to
reinforce the Nordic strain of the Persians and
the net result was the entire loss of the Greek
stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a question whether the Armenians of Asia
Minor derived their Aryan speech from this invasion
of the Nordic Persians, or whether they received
it at an earlier date from the Phrygians and from
the west. These Phrygians entered Asia Minor
by way of the Dardanelles and broke up the Hittite
Empire. Their language was Aryan and probably
was related to Thracian. In favor of the
theory of the introduction of the Armenian language
by the Phrygians from the west, rather
than by the Persians from the east, is the highly
significant fact that the basic structure of that
tongue shows its relationship to be with the western
or Centum rather than with the eastern or
Satem group of Aryan languages and this, too, in
spite of a very large Persian vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Armenians themselves, like all the other
natives of the plateaux and highlands as far east
as the Hindu Kush Mountains, while of Aryan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>speech, are of the Armenoid subdivision, in sharp
contrast to the predominant types south of the
mountains in Persia, Afghanistan and Hindustan,
all of which are dolichocephalic and of Mediterranean
affinity but generally betraying traces of
admixture with still more ancient races of Negroid
origin, especially in India.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to the last and easternmost extension
of Aryan languages in Asia. As mentioned
above, the grasslands and steppes of Russia extend
north of the Caucasus Mountains and the
Caspian Sea to ancient Bactria, now Turkestan.
This whole country was occupied by the Nordic
Sacæ and the closely related Massagetæ. These
Sacæ may be identical with the later Scythians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after the opening of the second millennium
B. C. and perhaps even earlier, the first Nordics
crossed over the Afghan passes, entered the plains
of India and organized a state in the Punjab, “the
land of the five rivers,” bringing with them Aryan
speech to a population probably of Mediterranean
type and represented to-day by the Dravidians.
The Nordic Sacæ arrived later in India and introduced
the Vedas, religious poems, which were at
first transmitted orally but which were reduced to
written form in Old Sanskrit by the Brahmans at
the comparatively late date of 300 A. D. From
this classic Sanskrit are derived all the modern
Aryan languages of Hindustan, as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Singalese of Ceylon and the chief dialects of
Assam.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is great diversity among scholars as to the
date of the first entry of these Aryan-speaking
tribes into the Punjab but the consensus of opinion
seems to indicate a period between 1600 and 1700
B. C. or even somewhat earlier. However, the very
close affinity of Sanskrit to the Old Persian of
Darius and to the Zendavesta would strongly indicate
that the final introduction of Aryan languages
in the form of Sanskrit occurred at a much later
time. The most recent tendency is to bring these
dates somewhat forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>If close relationship between languages indicates
correlation in time then the entry of the Sacæ into
India would appear to have been nearly simultaneous
with the crossing of the Caucasus by the Nordic
Cimmerians and their Persian successors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relationship between the Zendavesta and
the Sanskrit Vedas is as near as that between High
and Low German and consequently such close
affinity prevents our thrusting back the date of the
separation of the Persians and the Sacæ more than
a few centuries.</p>

<p class='c007'>A simultaneous migration of nomad shepherds
on both sides of the Caspian-Aral Sea would naturally
occur in a general movement southward
and such migrations may have taken place several
times. In all probability these Nordic invasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>occurred one after another for a thousand years or
more, the later ones obscuring and blurring the
memory of their predecessors.</p>

<p class='c007'>When shepherd tribes leave their grasslands
and attack their agricultural neighbors, the reason
is nearly always a famine due to prolonged drought
and causes such as these have again and again in
history put the nomad tribes in motion over large
areas. During many centuries fresh tribes composed
of Nordics or under the leadership of Nordics
but all Aryan-speaking, poured over the
Afghan passes from the northwest and pushed before
them the earlier arrivals. Clear traces of these
successive floods of conquerors are to be found in
the Vedas themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Zendic form of the Iranian group of Aryan
languages was spoken by those Sacæ who remained
in old Bactria and from it is derived a whole group
of closely related dialects still used in the Pamirs of
which Ghalcha is the best known.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sacæ and Massagetæ were, like the Persians,
tall, blond dolichocephs and they have left behind
them dim traces of their blood among the living
Mongolized nomads of Turkestan, the Kirghizes.
Ancient Bactria maintained its Nordic and Aryan
aspect long after Alexander’s time and did not become
Mongolized and receive the sinister name of
Turkestan until the seventh century, when it was
the first victim of the series of ferocious invasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>from the north and east, which under various
Mongol leaders destroyed civilization in Asia and
threatened its existence in Europe. These conquests
culminated in 1241 A. D. at Wahlstatt in
Silesia where the Germans, though themselves
badly defeated, put a final limit to this westward
rush of Asiatics.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sacæ were the most easterly members of
the Nordic race of whom we have definite record.
The Chinese knew well these “green eyed devils,”
whom they called by their Tatar name, the “Wu-suns,”—the
tall ones—and with whom they came
into contact about 200 B. C. in what is now Chinese
Turkestan. Other Nordic tribes are recorded
in this region. Evidence is accumulating that central
Asia had a large Nordic population in the
centuries preceding the Christian era. The discovery
of the Aryan Tokharian language in Chinese
Turkestan considered in connection with other
facts indicates intensive occupation by Nordics of
territories in central Asia now wholly Mongol, just
as in Europe dark-haired Alpines occupy large territories
where in Roman times fair-haired Nordics
were preponderant. In short we find both in Europe
and in western and central Asia the same
record of Nordic decline during the last two thousand
years and their replacement by races of inferior
value and civilization.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Tokharian is undoubtedly a pure Aryan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>language related, curiously enough, to the western
group rather than to the Indo-Iranian. It has
been deciphered from inscriptions recently found
in northeast Turkestan and was a living language
prior to the ninth century A. D.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the wonderful conquests of the Sacæ there
remain as evidence of their invasions only these
Indian and Afghan languages. Dim traces of
their blood have been found in the Pamirs and
in Afghanistan, but in the south their blond traits
have vanished, even from the Punjab. It may be
that the stature of some of the Afghan hill tribes
and of the Sikhs and some of the facial characters
of the latter are derived from this source, but all
blondness of skin, hair or eye of the original Sacæ
has utterly vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The long skulls all through India are to be attributed
to the Mediterranean race rather than to
this Nordic invasion, while the Pre-Dravidians and
Negroids of south India, with which the former are
largely mixed, are also dolichocephs.</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, the introduction in Iran and India of
Aryan languages, Iranian, Ghalchic and Sanskrit,
represents a linguistic and not an ethnic conquest.</p>

<p class='c006'>In concluding this revision of the racial foundations
upon which the history of Europe has been
based it is scarcely necessary to point out that the
actual results of the spectacular conquests and invasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>of history have been far less permanent
than those of the more insidious victories arising
from the crossing of two diverse races and that in
such mixtures the relative prepotency of the various
human subspecies in Europe appears to be in
inverse ratio to their social value.</p>

<p class='c007'>The continuity of physical traits and the limitation
of the effects of environment to the individual
only are now so thoroughly recognized by
scientists that it is at most a question of time when
the social consequences which result from such
crossings will be generally understood by the public
at large. As soon as the true bearing and import
of the facts are appreciated by lawmakers a complete
change in our political structure will inevitably
occur and our present reliance on the influence of
education will be superseded by a readjustment
based on racial values.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bearing in mind the extreme antiquity of physical
and spiritual characters and the persistency
with which they outlive those elements of environment
termed language, nationality and forms of
government, we must consider the relation of these
facts to the development of the race in America.
We may be certain that the progress of evolution
is in full operation to-day under those laws of nature
which control it and that the only sure guide
to the future lies in the study of the operation of
these laws in the past.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>We Americans must realize that the altruistic
ideals which have controlled our social development
during the past century and the maudlin sentimentalism
that has made America “an asylum
for the oppressed,” are sweeping the nation toward
a racial abyss. If the Melting Pot is allowed to
boil without control and we continue to follow our
national motto and deliberately blind ourselves to
all “distinctions of race, creed or color,” the type
of native American of Colonial descent will become
as extinct as the Athenian of the age of Pericles,
and the Viking of the days of Rollo.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The maps shown facing pages <a href='#i_266o'>266</a>, <a href='#i_268o'>268</a>, <a href='#i_270o'>270</a>, and <a href='#i_272o'>272</a> of
this book attempt in broad and somewhat hypothetical lines
to represent by means of color diagrams the original distribution
and the subsequent expansion and migration of the
three main European races, the Mediterranean, the Alpine
and the Nordic, as outlined in this book.</p>

<h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>The Maximum Expansion of the Alpines with Bronze Culture, 3000–1800 B. C.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The first map (Pl. I) shows the distribution of these races
at the close of the Neolithic, as well as their later expansion.
It also indicates the sites of earlier cultures. The distribution
of megaliths in Asia Minor on the north coast of Africa
and up the Atlantic seaboard through Spain, France and
Britain to Scandinavia is set forth. These great stone
monuments were seemingly the work of the Mediterranean
race using, however, a culture of bronze acquired from the
Alpines. The map also shows the sites throughout Russia
of the kurgans, or ancient artificial mounds, distribution of
which seems to correspond closely with the original habitat
of the Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>In southwestern France there is indicated the area where
the Cro-Magnon race persisted longest and where traces of it
are still to be found. The site is shown of the type station
of the latest phase of the Paleolithic known as the Mas
d’Azil—a great cavern in the eastern Pyrenees from which
that period took its name of Azilian.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the entrance of the Baltic Sea is also shown the type
station of the Maglemose culture which flourished at the
close of the Paleolithic and was probably the work of early
Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the centre of the district occupied by the Alpines is
located Robenhausen, the most characteristic of the Neolithic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>lake dwelling stations and also the Terramara stations in
which a culture transitional between the Neolithic and the
bronze existed. In the Tyrol the site is indicated of the
village of Hallstatt, which gave its name to the first iron
culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The site of La Tène at the north end of Lake Neuchâtel
in Switzerland is also shown. From this village the La
Tène Iron Age takes its name.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty of depicting the shifting of races during
twelve centuries is not easily overcome, but the map attempts
to show that at the close of the Neolithic all the coast
lands of the Mediterranean and of the Atlantic seaboard up
to Germany and including the British Isles were populated
by the Mediterranean race, in addition, of course, to remnants
of earlier Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons, who probably,
at that date, still formed an appreciable portion of
the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The yellow arrows indicate the route of the migrations of
Mediterranean man, who appears to have entered Europe
from the east along the African littoral. But the main invasions
passed up through Spain and Gaul into the British
Isles, where from that time to this they have formed the
substratum of the population. In the central portion of
their range these Mediterraneans were swamped by the
Alpines, as shown by the spreading green, while in northern
Gaul and Britain the Mediterraneans were submerged afterward
by Nordics, as appears on the later maps.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrows and routes of migration shown on the yellow
area of this map indicate changes which occurred during the
Neolithic and perhaps earlier, but the pink and red arrows in
the northern and southeastern portions represent migrations
which were in full swing and in fact were steadily increasing
during the entire period involved. The next map shows
these Nordics bursting out of their original homeland in
every direction and in their turn conquering Europe.</p>

<img src='images/i_266o.jpg' alt='MAXIMUM EXPANSION of ALPINES with BRONZE CULTURE—3000–1800 B.C. (generalized scheme) by Madison Grant' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Between these two races, the Mediterranean and the Nordic,
there entered a great intrusion of Alpines, flowing from
the highlands of western Asia through Asia Minor and up
the valley of the Danube throughout central Europe and
thence expanding in every direction. Forerunners of these
same Alpines were found in western Europe as far back as
the closing Azilian phase of the Paleolithic, where they are
known as the Furfooz-Grenelle race and are thus contemporary
in western Europe with the earliest Mediterraneans.</p>

<p class='c007'>During all the Neolithic the Alpines occupied the mountainous
core of Europe, but their great and final expansion
occurred at the close of the Neolithic and the beginning of
the Bronze Period, when a new and extensive Alpine invasion
from the region of the Armenian highlands brought in the
Bronze culture. This last migration apparently followed the
routes of the earlier invasions and, in the extreme southwest,
it even reached Spain in small numbers, where its
remnants can still be found in the Cantabrian Alps. The
Alpines occupied all Savoy and central France, where from
that day to this they constitute the bulk of the peasant
population. They reached Brittany and to-day that peninsula
is their westernmost outpost. They crossed over in
small numbers to Britain and some even reached Ireland.
In England they were the men of the Round Barrows, but
nearly all trace of this invasion has vanished from the living
population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpines also reached Holland, Denmark and southwestern
Norway and traces of their colonization in these
countries are still found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has attempted to indicate the lines of this
Alpine expansion by means of the solid green spreading over
central Europe and Asia Minor, with outlying dots showing
the outer limits of the invasion. Black arrows proceeding
from the east denote its main lines and routes. Those
Alpines who crossed the Caucasus passed through southern
Russia and a side wave of the same migration passed down
the Syrian coast to Egypt and along the north coast of
Africa, entering Italy by way of Sicily. The last African
invasion left behind it the Giza round skulls of Egypt.
This final Alpine expansion taught the other races of Europe,
both Mediterranean and Nordic, the art of metallurgy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nordics apparently originated in southern Russia,
but long before the Bronze Period they had spread northward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>across the Baltic into Scandinavia, where they specialized
into the race now known as the Scandinavian or Teutonic.
On the map the continental Nordics are indicated
by pink and the Nordics of Scandinavia are shown in red.
At the very end of the period covered by this map, these
Scandinavian Nordics were beginning to return to the continent.
The routes of these migrations and their extent are
indicated by red arrows and circles respectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>To sum up, this map shows the expansion from central
Asia of the round skull Alpines across central Europe, submerging,
in the south and west, the little, dark, long skulled
Mediterraneans of Neolithic culture, while at the same time
they pressed heavily upon the Nordics in the north and introduced
Bronze culture among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>This development of the Alpines at the expense of the
Mediterraneans had a permanent influence in western Europe,
but in the north their impress was of a more temporary
character. It is probable that in the first instance they
were able to conquer the Nordics by reason of the superiority
of bronze weapons to stone hatchets. But no sooner
had they imparted the knowledge of the manufacture and
use of metal weapons and tools to the Nordics than the latter
turned on their conquerors and completely mastered them,
as appears on the next map.</p>

<h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>The Expansion of the Pre-Teutonic Nordics, 1800–100 B. C.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The second map (Pl. II) of the series shows the shattering
and submergence of the green Alpine area by the pink
Nordic area. It will be noted that in Italy, Spain, France
and Britain the solid green and the green dots have steadily
declined and in central Europe the green has been torn
apart and riddled in every direction by pink arrows and
pink dots, leaving solid green only in mountainous and infertile
districts. This submergence of the Alpines by the
Nordics was so complete that their very existence was forgotten
until in our own day it was discovered that the
central core of Europe was inhabited by a short, stocky,
round skulled race originally from Asia. To-day these Alpines are gradually recovering their influence in the world
by sheer weight of numbers. On this map the green Alpine
area is shown to be everywhere shrinking except in the
countries around the Carpathians and the Dnieper River,
where the Sarmatians and Wends are located. It was in
this district that the Slavic-speaking Alpines were developing.
Simultaneously with this expansion toward the west,
south and east of the continental Nordics, the Scandinavian
or Teutonic tribes appear on the scene in increasing numbers,
as shown by the red area and red arrows, pressing upon and
forcing ahead of them their kinsmen on the mainland.</p>

<div id='i_268o'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_268o.jpg' alt='EXPANSION OF THE PRE-TEUTONIC NORDICS 1800–100 B.C. (generalized scheme) by Madison Grant' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>The pink arrows in Spain show the invasion of Celtic-speaking
Nordics, closely related to the Nordic Gauls who
a little earlier had conquered France. This same wave of
Nordic invasion crossed the Channel and appears in the
pink dots of Britain and Ireland, where the intruders are
known as Goidels. These early Nordics were followed
some centuries later by another wave of kindred peoples
who were known as Brythons or Cymry in Britain and as
Belgæ on the continent. These Cymric Belgæ or Brythons
probably represented the mixed descendants of the earliest
Teutons who crossed from Scandinavia and had adopted
and modified the Celtic languages spoken by the continental
Nordics. These Cymric-speaking Nordics drove before
them the earlier Gauls in France and the Goidels in Britain,
but their impulse westward was very likely caused by the
oncoming rush of pure Teutons from Scandinavia and the
Baltic coasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Italy the pink arrows entering from the west show the
route of the invading Gauls, who occupied the country north
of the Apennines and made it Cisalpine Gaul, while the arrows
entering Italy from the northeast show the earlier invasions
of the Nordic Umbrians and Oscans, who introduced
Aryan speech into Italy. Farther east in Greece and the
Balkans, the pink arrows show the routes of invasion of the
Achæans and the kindred Phrygians of Homer as well as the
later Dorians and Cimmerians. In the region of the Caucasus,
the routes of the invading Persians are shown and,
north of the Caspian Sea, the line of migration of the Sacæ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>from the grasslands of southern Russia toward the east. In
the inset map in the upper right corner is shown the expansion
of these Nordics into Asia, where the Sacæ and closely
related Massagetæ occupied what is now Turkestan and
from this centre swarmed over the mountains of Afghanistan
into India and introduced Aryan speech among the
swarming millions of that peninsula.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the northern part of the main map the expansion of the
Teutonic Nordics is shown, with the Goths in the east and
Saxons in the west of the red area, but the salient feature is
the expansion of the pink at the expense of the green and
the ominous growth of the red area centring around Scandinavia
in the north.</p>

<h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>The Expansion of the Teutonic Nordics and Slavic Alpines, 100 B. C. to 1100 A. D.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>This map (Pl. III) shows the yellow area greatly diminished
in central and northern Europe, while it retains its supremacy
in Spain and Italy as well as on the north coast of
Africa. In the latter areas the green dots have nearly vanished
and have been replaced by pink and red dots. In central
Europe the green area is still more broken up and reduced
to a minimum. In the Balkans and eastern Europe,
however, two large centres of green, north and south of the
Danube respectively, represent the expanding power of the
Slavic-speaking Alpines. The pink area of the continental
Nordics is everywhere fading and is on the point of vanishing
as a distinctive type and of merging in the red. The
expansion of the Teutonic Nordics from Scandinavia and
from the north of Germany is now at its maximum and
they are everywhere pressing through the Empire of Rome
and laying the foundations of the modern nations of Europe.
The Vandals have migrated from the coasts of the Baltic to
what is now Hungary, then westward into France and
finally, after occupying for a while southern Spain, under
pressure of the kindred Visigoths to northern Africa, where
they established a kingdom which is the sole example we
have of a Teutonic state on that continent. The Visigoths
and Suevi laid the foundations of Spain and Portugal, while
the Franks, Burgundians and Normans transformed Gaul
into France.</p>

<img src='images/i_270o.jpg' alt='EXPANSION OF THE TEUTONIC NORDICS AND SLAVIC ALPINES 100 BC–1100 AD (generalized scheme) by Madison Grant' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Into Italy for a thousand years floods of Nordic Teutons
crossed the Alps and settled along the Po Valley. While
many tribes participated in these invasions, the most important
migration was that of the Lombards, who, coming
from the basin of the Baltic by way of the Danubian plains,
occupied the Po Valley in force and scattered a Teutonic
nobility throughout the peninsula. The Lombard and
kindred strains in the north give to that portion of the
peninsula its present predominance over the provinces south
of the Apennines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conquest of the British Isles by the Teutonic and Scandinavian
Nordics was far more complete than was their conquest
of Spain, Italy or even northern France. When these
Teutons arrived upon the scene, the ancient, dark Neolithics
had very largely absorbed the early Nordic invaders, Goidels
and Cymry alike. Floods of Saxons, of Angles and later of
Danes, crossed the Channel and the North Sea and displaced
the old population in Scotland and the eastern half of England,
while Norse Vikings following in their wake occupied
nearly all of the outlying islands and much of the coast.
Both these later invasions, Danish and Norse, passed around
the greater island and inundated Ireland, so that the big,
blond or red-haired Irishman of to-day is to a large extent a
Dane in a state of culture analogous to that of Scotland
before the Reformation.</p>

<p class='c007'>This map shows that the vitality of Scandinavia was far
from exhausted after sending for upward of two thousand
years tribe after tribe across to the continent and that it
was now producing an extraordinarily vigorous type, the
Vikings in the west and the equally warlike and energetic
Varangians in the east, who migrated back to the motherland
of the Nordics and laid the foundations of modern
Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>While all these splendid conquests were in full swing a
little known group of tribes was growing and spreading in
eastern and southern Germany and in Austria-Hungary
and occupying the lands left vacant by the Teutonic nations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>which had invaded the Roman Empire. From this centre
in the neighborhood of the Carpathians and in Galicia eastward
to the head of the Dnieper River, the Wends and Sarmatians
expanded in all directions. They were the ancestors
of those Alpines who are to-day Slavic-speaking. From this
obscure beginning came the bulk of the Russians and the
South Slavs. The expansion of the Slavs is one of the most
significant features of the Dark Ages and the author has
attempted to indicate the centre of expansion of these
tribes by green dots and green arrows, radiating in all directions
from the solid green area in Europe. To sum up this
map, the yellow area has steadily declined everywhere,
while in western Europe the green area is now limited to
the infertile and backward mountain regions. In eastern
Europe, however, this same green Alpine area is showing a
marvellous capacity for recovery, as will appear from the
map of the races of to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The red area is widely spread and occupies the river valleys
and the fertile lands and represents everywhere the ruling,
military aristocracy more or less thinly scattered over
a conquered peasantry of Mediterranean and Alpine blood.
One phenomenon of dire import is shown on the map, where,
coming from the districts north and east of the Caspian Sea,
certain black arrows are seen shooting westward into Europe,
reaching in one extreme instance as far as Châlons in France,
where Attila nearly succeeded in destroying what remained
of western civilization. These arrows mark respectively
Huns, Cumans, Avars, Magyars, Bulgars and other Asiatic
hordes, probably for the most part of Mongoloid origin and
coming originally from central Asia far beyond the range
of Aryan speech. These hordes of Mongoloids destroyed
the budding culture of Russia, while at a later date kindred
tribes under the name of Turks or Tatars flooded the Balkans
and the valley of the Danube but these later invasions entered
Europe from Asia Minor.</p>

  <h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>The Present Distribution of European Races</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The preparation of the last map (Pl. IV), showing the
present distribution of European races, was in some respects
a more intricate task than that of the earlier maps. The
main difficulty is that, as a result of successive migrations
and expansions, the different races of Europe are now often
represented by distinct classes. Numerically one type may
be in a majority, as are the Rumanians in eastern Hungary,
where they constitute nearly two-thirds of the population.
At the same time this majority is of no intellectual or social
importance, since all the professional and military classes in
Transylvania are either Magyar or Saxon. Under the existing
scheme of showing majorities by color these ruling minorities
do not appear at all. In this last map the yellow is
beginning to expand, especially in the British Isles. The
green also is recovering somewhat in central and western
Europe, but in the Balkans, eastern Germany, Austria
and above all in Poland and Russia, it has largely replaced
the former Nordic color. The pink, <em>i. e.</em>, the continental
Nordics as a distinct type, has entirely vanished and has
been everywhere replaced by the Teutonic red. This does
not mean that there are no existing remnants of the continental
Nordics, but it does mean that these remnants cannot
now be distinguished from the all-pervading and masterful
type of the Teutonic Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, this last map, as compared with the earlier ones,
although showing a steady shrinkage of the Nordic area,
brings out clearly the manner in which it centres around the
basins of the Baltic and the North Sea, radiating thence in
every direction and in decreasing numbers. The menace
of the continued expansion of the green area westward and
northward into the red area of the Nordics is undoubtedly
one of the causes of the present world war. This expansion
began as far back as the fall of Rome, but only in our day and
generation has this backward race even claimed a parity of
strength and culture with the Master Race.</p>

<p class='c006'>The purpose of these notes is to meet an insistent demand
for authorities for the statements made in the body of the
book. As was mentioned in the Introduction, in a work of
this compass and aim, mere lack of space forbade all but
the barest outlines, so that often an appearance of dogmatism
was the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a vast literature on the subjects discussed and
to give all the references would be almost a physical impossibility.
It is particularly difficult to name all that has appeared
in periodicals, since they have become so numerous,
especially during the last few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has in mind to refer only to those works which
bear directly on the most essential statements made and,
necessarily, to but a part of these. In many cases only books
which are most easily available have been used. The author
has intentionally quoted chiefly works in English, where
these exist, and when using foreign authorities has translated
the statements.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be clearly understood that the references are given
for the facts rather than the theories they contain. In no
case, unless specifically stated, is the author committed to
the conclusions drawn in the works cited. In order to present
all sides, authorities who differ in viewpoint are sometimes
listed, the reader being left to make his own decision
of the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hoped that the references will be of assistance to students
of anthropology and to those who care to inquire
further into the subjects under discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where an author is quoted frequently or for more than
one book, he is referred to merely by name; the book is
given by number immediately following. Its full title may
be ascertained in the bibliography.</p>

<p class='c015'>Page xix&#160;: line 22. Immutability of somatological or
bodily characters. Charles B. Davenport, pp. 225 <em>seq.</em> and
252 <em>seq.</em>: William E. Castle, 1, pp. 125 <em>seq.</em>; Frederick
Adams Woods, 3, p. 107; and Edwin G. Conklin, 1, pp. 191

bearing on this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>xix&#160;: 23. Immutability of psychical predispositions and
impulses. See note above. Professor Irving Fisher said,
on p. 627 of <cite>National Vitality</cite>, speaking of laws relating to
eugenics: “What such laws might accomplish may be judged
from the history of two criminal families, the ‘Jukes’ and
the ‘Tribe of Ishmael.’ Out of 1,200 descendants from the
founder of the ‘Jukes’ through 75 years, 310 were professional
paupers&#160;... 50 were prostitutes, 7 murderers, 60
habitual thieves, and 130 common criminals.” Certainly
these facts were not all due entirely to identity or similarity
of environment. On p. 675 we read: “Similarly, the ‘Tribe
of Ishmael,’ numbering 1,692 individuals in six generations,
has produced 121 known prostitutes and has bred hundreds
of petty thieves, vagrants and murderers. The history of
the tribe is a swiftly moving picture of social degeneration
and gross parasitism extending from its seventeenth century
convict ancestry to the present day horde of wandering and
criminal descendants.” See R. L. Dugdale and Oscar C.
McCulloch, pp. 154–159. For transmission of opposite tendencies
see pp. 675–676, Fisher. The Jukes were a family of
Dutch descent, living in an isolated valley in the mountains
of northern New York. The Ishmaels were a family of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>central Indiana which came from Maryland through Kentucky.
The Kalikak family is another striking instance.

<p class='c007'>14&#160;: 10 <em>seq.</em> Blends. E. G. Conklin remarks in correspondence:
“In so far as races interbreed, their characters
mingle but do not blend or fuse, and come out again in all
their purity in descendants.” See also the same authority,
1, pp. 208, 280, 282–287.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every now and then an observation is met with which
corroborates this statement. The inheritance from one parent
or the other of the shape of the skull, in a fairly pure
form, has been noted a number of times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fleure and James in their study of the <cite>Anthropological
Types in Wales</cite>, p. 39, make the following observation: “It
may be said that certain component features of head form,
in many cases, seem to segregate more or less in Mendelian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>fashion, but this is a matter for further investigation; we
are on safer ground in saying that the children of parents
of different head form very frequently show a fairly complete
resemblance to one or other parent, <em>i. e.</em>, that head form is
frequently inherited in a fairly pure fashion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Luschan found still more striking evidence of this
in his study of modern Greeks, which he describes in his
<cite>Early Inhabitants of Western Asia</cite>. He has found that the
children of parents of different head form inherit in quite
strict fashion the shape of skull of one or the other parent,
and that the population, instead of being mesaticephalic, is
to-day as distinctly divided into two groups, dolichol- and
brachycephalic, as in prehistoric times, in spite of the constant
intermixture that has occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>14&#160;: 18. See notes to p. 13. This is a statement made
by Dr. Davenport, in correspondence.</p>

<p class='c007'>15&#160;: 29 <em>seq.</em> Professor G. Elliot Smith, <cite>The Ancient Egyptians</cite>,
chap. IV, and pp. 41 <em>seq.</em> On p. 43 we read: “If we
want to add to such sources of information and complete
the picture of the early Egyptian&#160;... he can be found reincarnated
in his modern descendants with surprisingly little
change, either in physical characteristics or mode of life, to
show for the passage of six thousand years.” On p. 44:
“Although alien elements from north and south have been
coming into Upper Egypt for fifty centuries, it has been a
process of percolation, and not an overwhelming rush; the
population has been able to assimilate the alien minority
and retain its own distinctive features and customs with only
slight change; and however large a proportion of the population
has taken on hybrid traits resulting from Negro, Arab,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>or Armenoid admixture, there still remain in the Thebaid
large numbers of its people who present features and bodily
conformation precisely similar to those of their remote ancestors,
the Proto-Egyptians.” See also G. Sergi, 1, p. 65,

<p class='c007'>19&#160;: 3. Anders Retzius was the first to make use of the
head form in anthropological study, and to give the impetus
to the index measurement system in <cite>The Form of the Skulls
of the Northern Peoples of Europe</cite>. See also A. C. Haddon, 1,
chap. I, in which he discusses these traits in full, and Ripley,
chap. III, especially pp. 55 <em>seq.</em> Modern physical anthropologists
still agree that the skull form is a most stable and
reliable character.</p>

<p class='c007'>19&#160;: 25. Ripley, p. 39.</p>

<p class='c007'>19&#160;: 27–pp. 20 and 21. Beddoe, Broca, Collignon, Livi,
Topinard and a host of other anthropologists all affirm the
existence of three European racial types, which Ripley has
discussed exhaustively. Deniker alone differs from them in
classifying the populations of Europe, from the same data,
into six principal races and four or more sub-races. See
Appendix D, in Ripley’s <cite>Races of Europe</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three terms, Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean, have
now become quite generally accepted designations for the
three European races. The term Nord, rather than Nordic,
has been chosen, perhaps more wisely, by some authors.
In the present book these names are applied with quite different
connotations from those usually understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be too clearly stated that in speaking of Nordics,
the proto-type was probably quite generalized, with hair
shades including the browns and reds. In the author’s
opinion the blond Scandinavian represents an extreme specialization
of Nordic characters. (See p. 167 of this book.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>20&#160;: 5–24. The term Nordic was first used by Deniker.
The authorities for the descriptions of these races may all
be found in Ripley. The Mediterranean race was first defined
by Sergi, who also calls it Eurafrican. The term Alpine,
proposed by Linnæus, was revived by DeLapouge, and
later adopted by Ripley, since when it has come into general
use. Sergi and Zaborowski prefer that of Eurasian. While
this latter name does cover the requirements, since it correctly
signifies not only the European and Asiatic range of the people
under discussion, but also their actual relationship to
Asiatics, it is objectionable because it implies the adoption
of the similarly constructed term Eurafrican, which, as defined
by Sergi, is misleading. Correct as Eurafrican may be
for signifying the European and African range of the Mediterranean
race, it involves an acceptance of the theory put
forward by its sponsor, that the Mediterranean race originated
in Africa and is closely related to the negro, both being
long skulled peoples, descended from a common stock, the
Eurafrican.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief objection to the term Mediterranean is that the
race extends in habitat beyond the Mediterranean region,
but the name is now so generally accepted and this fact so
well known that misunderstandings are unlikely. The term
Alpine, also, is not as inappropriate as it might seem, since
the word Alps is frequently not confined to the Swiss ranges
but extended to many other mountain chains, and Alpine,
like the term Mediterranean, is not, at this late date, apt to
be misunderstood.</p>

other references to this fact, especially in articles in various
anthropological journals, and general works on anthropology,
such as those of Deniker, Collignon, Martin and Ratzel.</p>

<p class='c007'>23&#160;: 16. For the differentiation of skull types in Europe
during the Paleolithic period, see Keith, 2, the chapters on
Pre-Neolithic, Mousterian and Neanderthal man; and 1,

the Paleolithic in the table on p. 18.</p>

<p class='c007'>24&#160;: 3–5. This claim was put forth by Sergi, in his <cite>Mediterranean
Race</cite>, pp. 252, 258–259, and was followed by Ripley
in his <cite>Races of Europe</cite>.</p>

can generally be sure that the eyes will be of a corresponding
shade. Bassanovitch,&#160;... p. 29, strikingly confirms
this rule even for so dark a population as the Bulgarian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>25&#160;: 13. Sir Edmund Loder, in correspondence, February,
1917,   asks: “Has it been noticed at Creedmore and elsewhere
in America that nearly all noted shots have blue eyes? It
has been very noticeable at Wimbledon and Bisby, where it
was quite exceptional to find a man in the front rank of
marksmen with dark colored eyes. There was, however, one
man who shot in my team who had very dark eyes and was
one of the best shots of the day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>25&#160;: 16. There are said to be blue eyes occasionally in
other races, where traces of Nordic blood cannot be discovered.
Green and blue eyes have been found among the
Rendeli (Desert Masai), although they are otherwise normal
negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>25&#160;: 19. The following quotation is from Von Luschan,
1, p. 224: “In Marmaritza near Halikarnassos, where a
British squadron had a winter station for many years, a
very great proportion of the children is said to be ‘flaxen-haired.’”
According to a statement made to the author by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Professor G. Elliot Smith on May 4, 1920, a similar nest of
blondness is found in the Egyptian delta near Aboukir and
is due to the fact that after the battle of the Nile the Seaforth
Highlanders were long stationed there. At one time
this blondness was supposed to bear some relation to the
ancient Lybian blondness depicted on the monuments.</p>

<p class='c007'>25&#160;: 25 <em>seq.</em> On the Berbers see Sergi, 4, pp. 59 <em>seq.</em>, and
Topinard, 3. In regard to the Albanians, Ripley refers to
their blondness, on p. 414, as follows: “The Albanian colonists,
studied by Livi and Zampa in Calabria, still, after four
centuries of Italian residence and intermixture, cling to many
of their primitive characteristics, notably their brachycephaly
and their relative blondness.” See also Zampa, 1,
and Deniker, 1, for scientific discussions of their physical
characters. Giuffrida-Ruggeri gives a summary of the most
recent literature on Albania.</p>

and sufficient for our purpose, recent investigations have
shown that other factors also contribute to straightness or
kinkiness, such as coarseness of texture, as opposed to fineness.
Probably these will be determined by Mr. Louis R.
Sullivan, of the American Museum of Natural History, who
is working on the subject. It has been found that the Japanese
and Eskimo are exceptions to the rule of “straight hair,
round cross section,” for they show an ellipse. There is also
a wide range of variation in the cross-sections of hair for individuals
of any race, who are classified according to the
preponderance of cross-sections of a single type. For a fine
series of plates which are photographs of the magnified hair
of individuals of various races, see <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Haupthaar und seiner

pp. 246–272. Deniker likewise treats of them in <cite>Races of
Man</cite>, p. 356. Minns, <cite>Scythians and Greeks</cite>, p. 37, says:
“Klaproth first proved in 1822 that the Ossetes are the same
as the Caucasian Alans, and this is supported by the testimony
of the chroniclers, Russian, Georgian, Greek and
Arab. From Ammianus Marcellinus (XXXI, II, 16–25) we
know that at the time of the Huns’ invasion these Alans pastured
their herds over the plains to the north of the Caucasus,
and made raids upon the coast of the Mæotis and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>peninsula of Taman. The Huns passed through their land,
plundering Ermanrich, the king of the Goths.... Ammianus
means by Alans all the nomadic tribes about the Tanais
(Don) and gives a description of their habits, borrowed from
the account of the Scythians in Herodotus. For the first
three centuries of our era we find these Alans mentioned
(Pliny, <cite>N. H.</cite>, IV, 80; Dionysius Perigetes, 305, 306; Fl.
Josephus, Bell. Jud., VII, VII, 4; Ptolemy, etc.), as neighbors
of the Sarmatians on this side or the other of the Don, living
the same life and counting as one of their tribes. That
is, that the Ossetes, Jasy, Alans, Sarmatians<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> are all of one
stock, once nomad, now confined to the valleys of the central
chain of the Caucasus. The Ossetes are tall, well-made,
and inclined to be fair, corresponding to the description of
the Alans in Ammianus (XXXI, II, 21) and their Iranian
language answers to the accounts of the Sarmatians, of
whom Pliny says ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medorum ut ferunt soboles</span>’ (<cite>N. H.</cite>, VI,
19).”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. The author agrees with Zaborowski and differs from Minns in
his belief that the Ossetes are of Nordic stock while the Sarmatians
were Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>66&#160;: 16. Alans. See Jordanes, <cite>History of the Goths</cite>,
Mierow translation. Procopius, writing about 550 A. D.,
says: “At this time the Alani and the Absagi were Christians
and friends of the Romans of old and lived in the
neighborhood of the Caucasus.” In his vol. III, chap. II,
2–8, we read of the period from 395–425 A. D. “There were
many Gothic nations in earlier times just as also at the
present, but the greatest and most important of all are the
Goths, Vandals, Visigoths and Gepædes. In ancient times,
however, they were named Sauromatæ and Melanchlæni,
and there were some too who called these nations Getic.
All these, while they are distinguished from one another by
their names, as has been said, do not differ in anything else
at all. For they all have white bodies and fair hair and are
tall and handsome to look upon, and they use the same
laws, and practise a common religion. For they are all of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the Arian faith and have one language called ‘Gothic.’”
(Procopius thinks they all came originally from one tribe,
and were distinguished later by the names of those who led
each group of old. They dwelt north of the Danube and
later the Gepædes took possession of the portion south of the
river. In regard to the derivation of the Goths and other
tribes from the Sauromatæ, compare the note on Sarmatians,
for p. 143&#160;: 21.) As to the Goths in the Crimea see Zeuss,

<p class='c007'>70&#160;: 12–71: 6. These paragraphs elicited a very interesting
letter from a British officer in Howrah, Bengal, India,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>in October, 1919. He says: “May I offer one or two remarks
on points of detail? On p. 70 it is stated ‘The Hindu
to-day speaks a very ancient form of Aryan language but
there remains not one recognizable trace of the blood of the
white conquerors who poured in through the passes of the
Northwest,’ and again at p. 261, ‘Of all the wonderful conquests
of the Sacæ there remain as evidence of their invasions
only these Indian and Afghan languages. Dim
traces of their blood, as stated before, have been found in
the Pamirs and in Afghanistan, but in the South their blond
traits have vanished, even from the Punjab. It may be
that the stature of some of the Afghan hill tribes and of the
Sikhs, and some of the facial characters of the latter, are
derived from this source, but all blondness of skin, hair and
eye of the original Sacæ have utterly vanished.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“This hardly agrees with my own observations during two
years’ service in the Punjab and Northwest Frontier Province.
I should say that among the Pathans living in British
territory about Peshawar, blond traits,—fair skin, the color
of old ivory, red or brown hair, grey, green, or blue eyes,—are
as common as really black hair is in Scotland; while among
Panjabi Mussulmans living about Jhelum these traits are,
if not common, at least not extremely rare. Judging from
the experience of one squadron of cavalry, I should put the
proportion of men with blond traits at not less than one
per cent. The women, whom one does not see, must be
fairer than the men, as elsewhere. I have seen a small Panjabi
Mahommedan girl, from about Dera Ismail Khan with
<em>yellow</em> hair. I have also seen a <em>Sikh</em> with <em>red</em> hair, but that
was certainly exceptional.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These remarks are based on what I have seen myself,
though no statistics are kept and it is possible that I am
generalizing from insufficient data. It would not, however,
I think, be too much to say that ‘Blond traits are not uncommon
in Afghanistan, and are even to be found among
Mussulmans in the Northwestern Panjab.’ (Afghans and
Indian Mussulmans of course sometimes dye their beards
red, but this artificial blondness has not been confused with
the real thing.)”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>The following quotation is from <cite>The Outlook</cite> for March
10, 1920, which contains an article entitled “The Present
Situation in India,” by Major-General Thomas D. Pilcher,
of the British Army.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beside these castes there are tribes, and the Brahmin
from the Punjab has very little indeed in common with the
Brahmin from Bengal or Madras. Many Pathans and
Punjabi Mohammedans have blue eyes and are no darker
than a southern European, whereas some of the depressed
tribes are as black as Negroes. Many of the northern peoples
are at least as tall as men of our own race, whereas other
tribes do not average five feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>70&#160;: 16. Castes. Deniker, 2, p. 403: “About 2,000 castes
may be enumerated at the present day, but year by year
new ones are being called into existence as a certain number
disappear.” In his footnote Deniker says: “The so-called
primitive division into four castes: Brahmans (priests),
Kshatriya (soldiers), Vaisyas (husbandmen and merchants),
and Sudra (common people, outcasts, subject peoples?),
mentioned in the later texts of the Vedas, is rather an indication
of the division into three principal classes of the ruling
race as opposed, in a homogeneous whole, to the conquered
aboriginal race (fourth caste).” He continues: “The essential
characteristics of all castes, persisting amid every change
of form, are endogamy within themselves and the regulation
forbidding them to come into contact one with another and
partake of food together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>See also Zaborowski, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les peuples aryens</span></cite>, p. 65. There is,
of course, an enormous number of books which deal with the
caste system of India.</p>

<p class='c007'>71&#160;: 7. Sir G. Archdall Reid, 2, p. 186: “If history teaches
any lesson with clearness, it is this, that conquest, to be
permanent, must be accompanied with extermination; otherwise,
in the fulness of time, the natives expel or absorb the
conquerors. The Saxon conquest of England was permanent;
of the Norman conquest there remains scarcely a trace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>72&#160;: 19. Ripley, pp. 219–220, says: “The race question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>in Germany came to the front some years ago under rather
peculiar circumstances. Shortly after the Franco-Prussian
War, De Quatrefages promulgated the theory&#160;... that the
dominant people in Germany were not Teutons at all, but
were directly descended from the Finns. Being nothing but
Finns, they were to be classed with the Lapps and other
peoples of western Russia.... Coming at a time of profound
national humiliation in France&#160;... the book created
a profound sensation.... A champion of the Germans
was not hard to find. Professor Virchow of Berlin set himself
to work to disprove the theory which thus damned the
dominant people of the empire. The controversy, half political
and half scientific, waxed hot at times.... One great
benefit flowed indirectly from it all, however. The German
government was induced to authorize the official census of
the color of hair and eyes of the six million school children of
the empire.... It established beyond question the differences
in pigmentation between the North and the South of
Germany. At the same time it showed the similarity in
blondness between all the peoples along the Baltic. The
Hohenzollern territory was as Teutonic in this respect as the
Hanoverian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>84&#160;: 11 <em>seq.</em> A letter from Abraham C. Strite, a lawyer of
Hagerstown, Maryland, contains additional information on
the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch. Mr. Strite says: “They
are not Palatine Germans, but largely Swiss who speak a
dialect of German. The writer happens to be of this stock.
Its characteristics are round head, black hair, dark brown
eyes, stocky stature, brunet type, all clearly indicating, according
to your analysis, an Alpine origin. This description
fairly well averages up the prevailing Pennsylvania Dutch
type of this section although there are some red heads and
some blonds which would indicate a Nordic admixture,
again meeting your argument. There are many other varieties
of Teutons in this section, but I am confining my remarks
to the class known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. I have never
made any head measurements among them but I am of the
opinion that the round-headed type vastly predominates.
The ancestors of these people emigrated from southern Europe,
mostly Switzerland, in quite some numbers between the
years 1700 and 1775, and settled in Lancaster County, Pa.;
from thence they have spread out over the adjoining sections
of Pennsylvania, down through the Cumberland valley
and into the valley of Virginia, and to-day they form an
important element of the population. They are the organizers
in America of the religious sect known as the Mennonites.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The early settlers of Germantown who were Mennonites,
were of Palatine stock. Of this there can be no doubt.
Later immigration to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, which
constituted the bulk of the Pennsylvania Dutch stock will be
found, I think, largely to have come from Switzerland, although
not exclusively. Rupp’s <cite>30,000 Names of Immigrants
to America</cite> gives the names, dates and sailings of this Mennonite
stock. Your conclusions are correct enough for all
practical purposes but it seemed to me that the immigrants
from Switzerland and from the Palatinate might be distinguished.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Doctor C. P. Noble, of Radnor, Pa., writes concerning the
Pennsylvania Dutch: “I have seen much of them as patients
and as I have observed them they have the medium stature
and stocky build of the Alpines, also they have, usually,
broad, round faces which are associated with brachycephaly
and certainly they have always exhibited peasant traits.
Moreover, it is unusual to find a blond among them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Doctor Jordan, of the Pennsylvania Historical Society,
furnished Doctor Noble with some data concerning them.
That there were some Alpine elements among them will appear
from what follows. Doctor Jordan agreed that the
present day Pennsylvania Germans are almost exclusively
brunet, with stocky bodies of moderate height. Existing
portraits of various leaders among them when they arrived
in Pennsylvania showed the same types. Furthermore,
Doctor Jordan’s extensive reading of early documents relating
to them tends to confirm the belief that the present day
descendants represent the original types. Tall blonds
are very rare among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doctor Noble knows some individuals with Nordic traits,
but these were acquired by intermarriage with Anglo-Saxons.
Most of these groups came from southern Germany, from
Silesia on the east to the Palatinate on the west.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following are Doctor Jordan’s notes:</p>

<p class='c007'>Moravians. They were located in Pennsylvania, at first
in Bethlehem and later in Nazareth. The land in Nazareth
was purchased of Whitfield, the predestinarian Methodist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moravian immigration was carefully supervised. The
church either owned or chartered the vessels which brought
over the immigrants. Frequently it was definitely arranged
as to how many artisans of each trade should come over so
that they would prosper on arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moravian immigration was small—about 500 up to
1750. Until about 1840 the Moravian settlements were
closed towns—no non-Moravians could buy property.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not one quarter of the present Moravians are descendants
of the early settlers. The rest are converts or descendants
of converts. A connection exists between the Moravians,
Huss and his Protestant followers, and the Waldenses. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>short résumé of this will be found in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>—under
Huss and Moravians—from the world standpoint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moravians migrated from Bohemia to Saxony and were
protected by Count Zinzendorf—a liberal Lutheran—and
lived on his estates. He assisted in their migration to Pennsylvania.
Some went to Georgia and later to Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c007'>Schwenkfelders. These were the followers of Kaspar
Schwenkenfeld (1490–1561). See the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>
for a short account. They formed a sect in Silesia
which has persisted. In 1720 a commission of Jesuits was
sent to convert them by force. Most of them fled into Saxony
and were protected by Count Zinzendorf. From thence
they migrated to Holland, England and Pennsylvania.
Frederick the Great, when he seized Silesia, protected those
remaining there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ursinus College, Collegeville, is Schwenkfelder. The sect
is not large and was located in or around Montgomery County.
Their migration to Saxony and also to Pennsylvania antedated
that of the Moravians. Generally speaking, they have
been much more aggressive and vigorous than the Moravians.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dunkards, Mennonites, Amish, and Seventh Day
Baptists (Wissahickon and Ephrata, Pennsylvania), came
from south Germany and the Palatinate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Harmony Society, small in numbers, the Lutherans
and German Reformed, came largely from south Germany
and the Palatinate, but also from other parts of Germany.
The Lutherans and the Reformed were the large sects in
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c007'>Germans from the Hudson valley migrated to Berks County
around Reading. The Swedes in New Jersey were almost
exclusively below Philadelphia—from Gloucester down the
Delaware River. Before the Revolution there were about
30,000 Germans in Pennsylvania, out of a total estimated
population of 100,000 to 120,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>84&#160;: 16. Scotch-Irish. See <cite>The Scotch-Irish in America</cite>,
by Henry Jones Ford; and also Sir George Trevelyan on the
Irish Protestants in chap. XI, vol. II, of <cite>George III and
Charles Fox</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>87&#160;: 24. In this connection it is interesting to note that
an early Egyptian king said almost the same concerning the
negroes of his time. The quotation is taken from Hall’s
<cite>Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, pp. 161–162, and is a translation
of a portion of the manifesto of Senusert III, of the
XIIth dynasty, which he caused to be set up at the time
of the Nubian wars: “Vigor is valiant, but cowardice is vile.
He is a coward who is vanquished on his own frontier, since
the negro will fall prostrate at a word; answer him, and he
retreats; if one is vigorous, he turns his back, retiring even
when on the way to attack. Behold, these people have nothing
terrible about them; they are feeble and insignificant;
they have buttocks for hearts. I have seen it, even I, the
majesty; it is no lie....”</p>

in America to the Amerindian is widespread, but is

discusses the Dorian conquest from p. 57 forward, and the
Homeric-Mycenæan period (1600–1100 B. C.) from p. 20. A
very interesting instance of the truth of the picture of Mycenæan
culture as drawn by Homer occurs on p. 50, where
it is stated that much described by the poet, even to small
articles, has been unearthed during archæological investigations.
“Although the poets who composed the Iliad and
Odyssey probably did not live before the ninth century, they
derived their matter from older lays.”</p>

<p class='c007'>99&#160;: 27. Crete. For systems of Cretan writing see Sir

of Excavations at Cnossus</cite>, <cite>Prehistoric Tombs of Knossos</cite>, and
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scripta Minoa</span></cite>. That the aboriginal “Eteocretan” language
existed until historic times is attested by the discoveries of
later inscriptions belonging to the fifth and succeeding centuries
B. C., which were written in Greek letters at this time
but in the indigenous, undecipherable tongue. They are
described by Comparetti, <cite>Mon. Ant.</cite>, III, pp. 451 <em>seq.</em>, and by
R. S. Conway, 2, 3, especially pp. 125 <em>seq.</em>, in vol. VIII. In
1908 another discovery was made by the Italian Mission at
Phæstus, of a clay disk with printed hieroglyphics which did
not belong to the Cretan system of writing. It is supposed
to have come from Asia Minor.</p>

From a later paper by Mr. Miller (2) we quote the following
from pp. 43–44:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The combined characters of the jaw, molars and skull
were made the basis of a genus Eoanthropus, placed in the
family Hominidæ.... While the brain case is human in
structure, the jaw and teeth have not yet been shown to
present any character diagnostic of man; the recognized
features in which they resemble human jaws and teeth are
merely those which men and apes possess in common. On
the other hand, the symphyseal region of the jaw, the canine
tooth and the molars are unlike those known to occur in any
race of men.... Until the combination of a human brain
case and nasal bones with an ape-like mandible, ape-like
lower molars and an ape-like upper canine has actually been
seen in one animal, the ordinary procedure of both zoology
and paleontology would refer each set of fragments to a
member of the family which the characters indicate. The
name Eoanthropus dawsoni has therefore been restricted to
the human elements of the original composite (Family Hominidæ),
and the name Pan vetus has been proposed for the
animal represented by the jaw (Family Pongidæ).”</p>

Gregory. Ray Lancaster has made some interesting observations
and is the most recent authority on this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>106&#160;: 14. On the Neanderthal Man see Osborn and his

<p class='c007'>107&#160;: 21. A note on p. 385 of Rice Holmes’s <cite>Ancient Britain</cite>
is useful in this connection. “MM. de Quatrefages and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Hamy affirm that the Neanderthal race has left a permanent
imprint on the population, and refer to various skulls
of the Neolithic and later periods which resemble more or
less closely that of Neanderthal. Moreover, it is generally
admitted that even at the present day a few individuals here
and there belong to the same type. But it does not follow
that these persons to whom Dr. Beddoe and M. Hamy refer
were descended from men who lived in Britain in the Paleolithic
age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Taylor, <cite>Origin of the Aryans</cite>, mentions several famous
men who had typical Neanderthal skulls, among them Robert
Bruce.</p>

<p class='c007'>110&#160;: 8. In Dordogne, France, there are people who look
as it is thought the Cro-Magnons did. These modern people
may belong to that type in the same way that here and there
people resembling the Neanderthals are still found. In
Dordogne these Cro-Magnon features are quite common,
and differ markedly from those of other Frenchmen. For
studies of this type see Collignon, 1. For full discussions of
the ancient Cro-Magnons see Keith, 1 and 2, and Osborn, 1.</p>

<p class='c007'>110&#160;: 11. Dr. Charles B. Davenport, in correspondence,
remarks: “There can be no doubt that the prolific shall inherit
the earth or the proletariat shall inherit the earth, which
is etymologically the same thing. We see this law in action
in Russia to-day.... Can we build a wall high enough
around this country, so as to keep out these cheaper races,
or will it be only a feeble dam which will make the flood all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the worse when it breaks? Or should we admit the four
million picks and shovels which many of our capitalists are
urging Congress to admit in order to secure what wealth we
can for the moment, leaving it for our descendants to abandon
the country to the blacks, browns and yellows, and seek
an asylum in New Zealand? I am inclined to think that the
thing to do is to make better selection of immigrants, admitting
them in fairly large numbers so long as we can sift out
the defective strains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>111&#160;: 20 <em>seq.</em> É. Cartailhac says, in <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La France préhistorique</span></cite>:
“The race of Cro-Magnon is well determined. There
is no doubt about their high stature and Topinard is not the
only one who believes that they were blonds.” See also G.
Retzius, 3. But he derives the Nordics from them. On
the other hand, the Dordogne people to-day are dark, and
many anthropologists are inclined to the belief that the
Cro-Magnons were brunets, a theory in which the writer
heartily concurs.</p>

such as Nilsson and Dawkins have also held this theory.</p>

<p class='c007'>112&#160;: 21. One of the few references to the bare possibility
of a Magdalenian dog occurs in Obermaier’s <cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Hombre
Fósil</span></cite>, the footnote on pp. 221 and 223. From this it appears
that certain conclusions are drawn that if the Alpera
paintings are of late Magdalenian age, if certain nondescript
animals in those paintings are intended for dogs and if
those dogs are meant to be in a state of domestication, then
there can be no doubt whatever that the dog was domesticated
in Magdalenian times. But Obermaier does not feel
that this furnishes satisfactory proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>112&#160;: 25–p. 113. Bow and Arrow. Obermaier, 1, chap.
V, <cite>The Upper Paleolithic</cite>, p. 112, says: “The coarse stone
implements of the lower Paleolithic no longer exist, being
replaced by an industry of very fine flints and&#160;... certain
lances with points made of bone, horn or ivory, which were
very generally used. The use of the bow is proved by certain
representations in mural pictures (<em>i. e.</em>, the Archers of
Alpera, etc., eastern Spain, Magdalenian; Archer of Laussel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>France, Aurignacian).” See the corresponding plates in
chap. VII.</p>

<p class='c007'>On p. 217 of chap. VII, <cite>Quaternary Art</cite>, there is a man
depicted in the pose of an archer. On p. 239 Obermaier
says: “Among&#160;... [the paintings of Alpera] are sketches
of more than 70 human figures,&#160;... 13 are shown in the
act of shooting an arrow at other men or animals.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> On
p. 241 he continues: “The paintings of eastern Spain of
Quaternary age also show archers.” A recent letter from
the Abbé Henri Breuil says that the bow and arrow did not
exist in France in Paleolithic times, and he is, of course,
aware of the Laussel figure found by Lalanne and referred
to by Obermaier as proof. Alpera is agreed by Obermaier
to be of Tardenoisian age, consequently of the transition
period to the Neolithic. Beside Alpera, the only other instance
of pictured bows and arrows noted occurs at Calpatá,
said to be of Upper Paleolithic age and Capsian industry.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. If the Alpera paintings are of this (Magdalenian?) period, then
the bow certainly existed at this time, but there is reason to believe
that the paintings belong to a later epoch.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>See Fig. 174, p. 353, of Osborn, 1, giving a large bison drawing
in the cavern of Niaux on the Ariège, showing the supposed
spear or arrowheads, attached to large shafts, which
are represented as having pierced its side. On p. 354 Osborn
says: “It is possible, although not probable, that the
bow was introduced at this time and that a less perfect flint
point, fastened to a shaft like an arrowhead, and projected
with great velocity and accuracy, proved to be far more
effective than the spear.... From these drawings and
symbols (Fig. 174), it would appear that barbed weapons of
some kind were used in the chase, but no barbed flints occur
at any time in the Paleolithic, nor has any trace been found
of bone barbed arrowheads, or any direct evidence of the
existence of the bow.” On p. 410: “Here [Cavern of Niaux]
for the first time are revealed the early Magdalenian methods
of hunting the bison, for upon their flanks are clearly traced
one or more arrow or spear heads with the shafts still attached;
the most positive proof of the use of the arrow is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>the apparent termination of the wooden shaft in the feathers
which are rudely represented in three of the drawings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>113&#160;: 3. Osborn, p. 456: “The flint industry [of the Azilian]
continues the degeneration begun in the Magdalenian
and exhibits a new life and impulse only in the fashioning of
extremely small or microlithic tools and weapons known as
‘Tardenoisian.’” See also pp. 465–475 for a more complete
discussion and their distribution as traced by de Mortillet.

<p class='c007'>Osborn continues, p. 450: “If it is true&#160;... that Europe
at the same time became more densely forested, the chase
may have become more difficult and the Cro-Magnons may
have begun to depend more and more upon the life of the
streams and the art of fishing. It is generally agreed that
the harpoons were chiefly used for fishing, and that many
of the microlithic flints, which now begin to appear more
abundantly, may have been attached to a shaft for the
same purpose. We know that similar microliths were used
as arrowpoints in pre-dynastic Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The microliths may have been used on darts for bird
hunting.</p>

known at present only from their industries, were advancing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>toward the close of the Upper Paleolithic along the northern
and southern shores of the Baltic and persisted for an appreciable
time before the arrival of the tribes introducing the
early Neolithic-Campignian culture which accumulated in the
Kitchen Middens along the same shores. Like the southern
races of the Azilian-Tardenoisian times these northerly tribes
were truly Pre-Neolithic, ignorant of both agriculture and
pottery; they brought with them no domesticated animals
excepting the dog, which is known at Mugem, at Tourasse
and at Oban, in northwestern Scotland.”</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CHAPTER III. THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGES</h4>

<p class='c015'>119: 1. See the Osborn tables. As evidence of far earlier
dates of the Neolithic in the east we may quote Sir A. J.
Evans, 2, p. 721. He calculates that the earliest settlement
at Knossos in Crete, which was <cite>Neolithic</cite>, is about 12,000
years old, for he assumes that in the western court of the
palace the average rate of deposit was fairly continuous.
Professor Montelius, in <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Anthropologie</span></cite>, t. XVII, p. 137,
argues from the stratigraphy of finds at Susa that the beginning
of the Neolithic Age in the east may be dated about
18,000 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>119: 6. See the note to p. 147.</p>

<p class='c007'>119: 15. Balkh. Balkh, in Afghanistan, was the capital
of Bactria, the ancient name of the country between the
range of the Hindu Kush and the Oxus, and is now for the
most part a mass of ruins, situated on the right bank of the
Balkh River. The antiquity and greatness of the place are
recognized by the native populations who speak of it as the
“Mother of Cities,” and it is certain that at a very early
date it was the rival of Ecbatana, Nineveh, and Babylon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bactria was subjugated by Cyrus and from then on formed
one of the satrapies of the Persian Empire. Zaborowski, 1,
p. 43, says: “After the conquests of Alexander there was
founded a Greco-Bactrian kingdom&#160;... which embraced
Sogdiana, Bactria and Afghanistan. The Greco-Bactrian
kings struck a quantity of coins. They bore a double legend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the one Greek, the other still called Bactrian, which is not
Zend, nor even the language really spoken in Bactria. It is
a popular dialect derived from Sanskrit.” Again on p. 185:
“Zend has been called, and is still called, Bactrian or Old
Bactrian, it may be because Bactria has been conceived as
the original country or an ancient place of sojourn of the
Persians; it may be because Zoroaster, a Median Magus, had,
according to a legend, fled to the Bactrians where he found
protection under Prince Vishtaspa. Eulogy of this prince
is often incorporated in the sayings of Zoroaster.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later a new race appeared, tribes called Scythians by
the Greeks, amongst which the Tochari, identical with the
Yuë-Chih of the Chinese, were the most important. According
to Chinese sources, they entered Sogdiana in 159
B. C.; in 139 they conquered Bactria, and during the next
generation they had made an end to the Greek rule in eastern
Iran. In the middle of the first century B. C. the whole of
eastern Iran and western India belonged to the great “Indo-Scythian”
Empire. In the third century the Kushan dynasty
began to decline; about 320 A. D. the Gupta Empire was
founded in India. In the fifth the Ephtalites, or “White
Huns,” subjugated Bactria; then the Turks, about A. D.
560, overran the country north of the Oxus. In 1220 Jenghis
Khan sacked Balkh and levelled all buildings capable of defence,
while Timur repeated this treatment in the fourteenth
century. Notwithstanding this, Marco Polo could still, in
the following century, describe it as “a noble city and a
great.”</p>

<p class='c007'>See also Raphael Pumpelly, <cite>Explorations in Turkestan</cite>,
where 10,000 years is said to be the age of the remains of
early civilization. More modern authorities, however, do
not accept these ancient dates.</p>

<p class='c007'>120: 28 <em>seq.</em> Oman, <cite>England before the Norman Conquest</cite>,
pp. 642 <em>seq.</em>, says: “The position which he [Harold] chose is
that where the road from London to Hastings emerges from
the forest, on the ground named Senlac, where the village of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Rattle now stands.... This hill formed the battleground....
On reaching the lower slopes of the English position
the archers began to let fly their shafts, and not without effect,
for as long as the shooting was at long range, there was
little reply, since Harold had but few bowmen in his ranks,
(the Fyrd, it is said, came to the fight with no defensive
weapons but the shield, and were ill-equipped, with javelins
and instruments of husbandry turned to warlike uses), and
the abattis, whatever its length or height, would not give
complete protection to the English. But when the advance
reached closer quarters, it was met with a furious hail of
missiles of all sorts—darts, lances, casting axes, and stone
clubs such as William of Poictiers describes, and the Bayeux
Tapestry portrays—rude weapons, more appropriate to the
neolithic age.... Many a moral has been drawn from
this great fight.... Neither desperate courage, nor numbers
that must have been at least equal to those of the invader,
could save from defeat an army which was composed
in too great a proportion of untrained troops, and which was
behind the times in its organization.... But the English
stood by the customs of their ancestors, and, a few years
before, Earl Ralph’s attempt to make the thegnhood learn
cavalry tactics (see the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle), had been
met by sullen resistance and had no effect.”</p>

On the other hand, from the anthropological point of
view, this subdivision can also be made. In the first stage
[Neolithic Lacustrian], we find only brachycephalic crania;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>in the second there are an almost equal number of brachycephalic
and dolichocephalic; in the third there is a predominance
of dolichocephalic” (that is, Schenck divides the
Neolithic into three periods according to skulls, and the
last runs into the age transitionary to bronze).</p>

<p class='c007'>121&#160;: 19. See both Keller and Schenck for the numbers of
dwellings.</p>

<p class='c007'>121&#160;: 22. <em>There were, of course, the caves and rock shelters
used during a large part of the year, but probably no other
regularly constructed dwellings served as permanent, all-the-year-round
places of abode prior to the lake dwellings, and it is
doubtful if these were inhabited in winter. It is generally believed
that the custom of building pile villages arose from considerations
of safety. This protection would be absent when
the lakes were frozen over, and at the same time the huts would
be exposed on all sides, including the floor, to the wintry blasts
sweeping the lakes. They would in this way be rendered practically
uninhabitable during the winter season.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Keller declares that the same type of dwelling is found
in the whole circle of countries which were formerly Celtic.
(Introduction, p. 2.) The Crannoges of Scotland and Ireland
continued in use until the age of iron in those countries. In
Switzerland the lake dwellings disappeared about the first
century (p. 7). The population was numerous (p. 432),
large enough to have to depend upon cattle and agriculture
(p. 479).</p>

<p class='c007'>This type of dwelling is found from Ireland to Japan, and
even in South America. Many lake dwellings exist at the
present day. The Welsh, Scotch and Irish Crannoges are
related in structure to the European fascine types (Keller,
p. 684 and Introduction). Others are built somewhat differently,
and are, of course, of independent origin. An ancient
site was unearthed at Finsbury, on the outskirts of
London not long since, where there used to be a marsh.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>The inhabitants of this lake-dwelling were native outcasts
during Romano-British times.</p>

<p class='c007'>121&#160;: 26. See Schenck, and Keller, p. 6. On p. 140 of
Keller we read: “The Pile Dwellings of eastern Switzerland
ceased to exist before the bronze age or at its beginnings;
those of western Switzerland came to their full development
during this period.” On p. 37, describing the settlement of
Mooseedorfsee Keller says: “A very striking circumstance
ought to be mentioned, namely, that even heavy implements,
such as stone chisels, grinding or sharpening stones, etc.,
were found quite high in the relic bed, while lighter objects,
such as those made out of bone, were met with much deeper.”
It is known that the Mooseedorfsee settlement is very old.
No metal has been found here, but a bone arrowhead is
described by Keller on p. 38. He remarks that the bones of
very large animals were uncommonly numerous. It seems
as if the earlier inhabitants were users of bone rather than
of stone implements.</p>

<p class='c007'>122&#160;: 1. Herodotus, V, 16 describes them. He also is the
source of our information regarding the keeping of cattle,
although archæological finds have proved the location of
stables out on the platforms between the houses. His interesting
account is given herewith: “Their manner of
living is the following. Platforms supported upon tall piles
stand in the middle of the lake, which are approached from
land by a single narrow bridge. At the first the piles which
bear up the platforms were fixed in their place by the whole
body of the citizens, but since that time the custom which
has prevailed about fixing them is this: they are brought
from a hill called Orbêlus, and every man drives in three for
each wife that he marries. Now the men all have many
wives apiece; and this is the way in which they live. Each
has his own hut, wherein he dwells, upon one of the platforms,
and each has also a trap door giving access to the lake beneath;
and their wont is to tie their baby children by the
foot with a string, to save them from rolling into the water.
They feed their horses and their other beasts upon fish,
which abound in the lake to such a degree that a man has
only to open his trap door and to let down a basket by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>rope into the water and then to wait a very short time,
when he draws it up quite full of them. The fish are of two
kinds, which they call the paprax and the tilon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>122&#160;: 3. In the Introduction, p. 2, and elsewhere Keller
says regarding cattle: “Cattle were kept, not on land, as in
the Terramara region, but on the platforms themselves,
out in the lakes. Many charred remains of stables and
stable refuse have been taken from the lakes, but only from
certain parts of the sites, between those of the houses.”

it a name. To the natives it is useless; it is gathered crude,
it is forwarded to Rome unshaped; they are astonished to
be paid for it. Yet you may infer that it is the exudation
of trees: certain creeping and even winged creatures are continually
found embedded; they have been entangled in its
liquid form and as the material hardens, are imprisoned. I
should suppose, therefore, that, just as in the secluded places
of the East, where frankincense and balsam are exuded, so
in the islands and lands of the West, there are groves and
glades more than ordinarily luxuriant,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amber, if rubbed, has magnetic qualities and develops electricity.
Our word “electricity” is derived from its Greek
name, “electron.” Tacitus says: “If you try the qualities
of amber by setting fire to it, it kindles like a torch and soon
dissolves into something like pitch and resin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>125&#160;: 15 <em>seq.</em> Copper. Reisner’s opinion that the pre-dynastic
Egyptians invented the use of copper (<cite>Naga-ed-Dêr</cite>,
I, p. 134) which is followed by Elliot Smith (<cite>Ancient
Egyptians</cite>, p. 3), is not the view held by all scholars. Hall
believes that the knowledge of the use of metal came to the
prehistoric southern Egyptians (<cite>Ancient History of the Near
East</cite>, p. 90), toward the end of the pre-dynastic age from
the north. But he counts the Mount Sinai and Cyprus deposits
as northern centres of origin from which a knowledge
of the working of the metal radiated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mines of the Sinaitic peninsula were worked for copper
at the time of Seneferu, about 3733 B. C., and probably
much earlier (Gowland, p. 245, and elsewhere), “but long
before the actual mining operations were carried on, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>long it is impossible to say, the metal must have been obtained
by primitive methods from the surface ore. It is
hence not unreasonable to assume that at least as early as
about 5000 B. C. the metal copper was known and in use in
Egypt.” The same writer believes “that an earlier date
than 5000 B. C. should be assigned to the first use of copper
in the Chaldean region.” In this he bases himself on the
discovery of copper figures associated with bricks and tablets
bearing the name of King Ur-Nina (about 4500 B. C.), and
the fact that the upper Tigris region is known to contain
rich deposits of the mineral. Jastrow, Jr., assigns the date
of 3000 B. C. to Ur-Nina, which may be more correct.
Gowland dates copper in Cyprus at 2500 B. C., or even 3000,
judging by the finds at Crete dated 2500 B. C. In the Troad
he thinks it was used not later than in Cyprus. For China
the date is unknown, but if we accept 2205, given in the
Chinese annals as the time when the nine bronze caldrons
were cast, which are often mentioned in the historical records,
then copper may have been in use as early as 3000, or even
earlier. De Morgan dates copper at 4400 B. C. in Egypt,
where it was found in the supposed tomb of Menes.</p>

<p class='c007'>See also Lord Avebury, <cite>Prehistoric Times</cite>, pp. 71–72, who
gives 3730 for copper-working in Sinai, and its first appearance
about 5000 B. C. Montelius, 1, p. 380, gives copper in
Cyprus as about 2500 B. C., hardly 3000; and for Egypt
5000; he regards it as having been known in Babylon at
about the same time. Breasted, <cite>Ancient Times</cite>, assigns the
date of the earliest copper as at least 4000 in Egypt.</p>

Near East</cite>, p. 28.</p>

<p class='c007'>126&#160;: 1. Elliot Smith, 1, p. 8: “Most serious scholars who
concern themselves with the problems of the ancient history
of Egypt and Babylonia have now abandoned these inflated
estimates of the lengths of the historical periods in
the two empires; and it is now generally admitted that
Meyer’s estimate of 3400±100 B. C. is a close approximation
to the date of the union of Upper and Lower Egypt
and that the blending of Semitic and Sumerian cultures in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Babylonia took place shortly after the time of this event in
the Nile valley.” See also Hall, <cite>Ancient History of the Near
East</cite>, p. 3.</p>

<p class='c007'>126&#160;: 7. Bronze. Rice Holmes, 1, p. 125: “The oldest
piece of bronze that has yet been dated was found at Medûm,
in Egypt, and is supposed to have been cast about 3700 B. C.
But the metal may have been worked even earlier in other
lands; for a bronze statuette and a bronze vase, which were
made twenty-five centuries before our era have been obtained
from Mesopotamia and the craft must have passed
through many stages before such objects could have been
produced. Yet it would be rash to infer that either the
Babylonians or the Egyptians invented bronze for neither
in Egypt nor in Babylonia is there any tin. The old theory
that it was a result of Phœnician commerce with Britain has
long been abandoned and British bronze implements are
so different from those of Norway and Sweden, Denmark and
Hungary, that it cannot have been derived from any of these
countries. German influence was felt at a comparatively
late period, but from first to last British bronze culture was
closely connected with that of Gaul and through Gaul with
that of Italy.”</p>

that the alloy used by the men of the Bronze Age generally
consists of copper and tin in the proportions of 9 to 1. I

evident that no single alloy could be equally suitable for
all.... It is worthy of note that these proportions (<em>i. e.</em>,

<p class='c007'>Some authorities think that iron, in Egypt at least, came
in about the same time as bronze, or even earlier. Certain
peoples missed altogether one or another of these stages, as
the absence of remains indicates. For instance, the central
Africans had, as far as is known, no bronze age, but passed
directly from the use of stone to that of iron. (See Rice
Holmes, <cite>Ancient Britain</cite>, p. 123.) See the notes to p. 129
on the value of iron. Occasional implements of any material
better than that ordinarily in use, which had been introduced
by trade or acquired by fighting, were very highly
prized. Any books on primitive peoples contain references
to the value of such “foreign tools.”</p>

study, Déchellette, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel d’archéologie</span></cite>, vol. I,
chap. III, especially paragraph v, pp. 393 <em>seq.</em>, for dolmens in
Brittany. Concerning the contents of these we may quote
the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Polished hatchets, often enough of rare stone, beads from
necklaces, and pendants of Callais or of divers materials,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>implements of flint, knives, arrow points which are wing-shaped,
scrapers, nodules, grinding stones, pottery, vases,
grains of baked earth, some rare jewels of gold, collars and
bracelets, such is, in general, the composition of the contents
of the neolithic dolmens of Brittany, contents different,
as we shall see, from those of the sepulchres of the Bronze
Age in the same region. These vast Armorican crypts belong
certainly to the end of the Neolithic period, in spite of
the absence of copper, the habitual forerunner of bronze objects.
The smallness of the crypt, the size of the tumulus,
the mixture of construction in huge blocks and in walls seem
to indicate, as M. Cartailhac has observed, a more recent
age than that of ordinary dolmens. In the pure Bronze
Age the monolithic supports are replaced by the walls of
unmortared stones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Moreover, we shall see that there have been found in
certain covered alleys in Brittany, pottery of a very characteristic
type called calciform vases, pottery belonging in
the south of France and southern Europe with the first objects
of copper and bronze. Jewels of gold confirm, on the
other hand, these chronological determinations.” On p.
397: “The dolmen sepulchres of the Bronze Age in Brittany,
and notably in Finisterre, are distinguished more often by
the type of their construction from those of the Stone Age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The dolmens of Normandy and Isle de France contain
some stone objects, fragments of vases, and numerous debris
of human skeletons.” The end of the pure Neolithic is the
date of the megaliths in Armorica, as we read on p. 407.
The first metals, imported from the south, penetrated into
northern Gaul a little later than in the southern provinces.
That is why certain typical objects of the end of the pure
Neolithic in Armorica, such as Callais and the calciform
vases, are associated with the first objects of copper or bronze
in the funerary crypts of Provence and Portugal.</p>

<p class='c007'>G. Elliot Smith and W. H. R. Rivers claim that there is a
close connection throughout the eastern hemisphere between
the distribution of megalithic monuments and either ocean
or fresh-water pearls, but this appears to the author to be
far-fetched. Two very recent articles dealing with megaliths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>are “Anthropology and Our Older Histories,” by Fleure
and Winstanley, and “The Menhirs of Madagascar,” by
A. L. Lewis.</p>

iron in Egypt came in about the same time as bronze, or
even earlier. A piece of worked iron was found in the Great
Pyramid, to which a date of about 3500 B. C. has been assigned.
But, according to the archæological investigations
of Professor Flinders Petrie, iron came into general use only
about 800 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>Myres, in <cite>The Dawn of History</cite>, is quoted from p. 60 for
the following neat summary, although any of the authorities
on Egypt, such as Petrie, Maspero, Hall, Breasted, Elliot
Smith, Reisner, Meyer, etc., should be consulted as original
investigators: “The presence of iron, rare though it is, as
far back as the first dynasty, puts Egypt into a position
which is unique among metal-using lands; for, apart from
these rare, but quite indisputable finds, Egypt remains for
thousands of years a bronze-using, and for long, a merely
copper-using, country.... In Egypt iron was known as
a rarity, worn as a charm and an ornament, and even used,
when it could be gotten ready made, as an implement;
and it does not seem to have been worked in the country,
and probably its source was unknown to the Egyptians.
In historic times they still called it the ‘metal of heaven’ as
if they obtained it from meteorites; and it looks at present
as though their earliest knowledge of it was from the south;
for central Africa seems to have had no bronze age but direct
and ancient transition from stone to iron weapons. Yet
when they conquered Syria in the sixteenth century, they
found it in regular use and received it in tribute. At home,
however, they had no real introduction to an ‘Age of Iron’
until they met an Assyrian army in 668 B. C. and began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>be exploited by Greeks from over sea.” In this connection
see also Ridgeway, <cite>The Early Age of Greece</cite>, pp. 613–614.
The same author, pp. 154 <em>seq.</em>, discusses the value of iron in
these early times.</p>

<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Grabfeld von Hallstatt</span></cite>; Dr. Moritz Hoernes, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Hallstattperiode</span></cite>;
Bertrand and Salomon Reinach, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Celts dans les
vallées du Pô et du Danube</span></cite>; and Ridgeway, <cite>The Early Age of
Greece</cite>, pp. 407–480 and 594 <em>seq.</em> There is a brief summary
by Ridgeway which it will serve to quote: “Everywhere
else the change from iron weapons to bronze is immediate
but at Hallstatt iron is seen gradually superseding bronze,
first for ornament, then for edging cutting implements, then
replacing fully the old bronze types and finally taking new
forms of its own. There can be no doubt that the use of
iron first developed in the Hallstatt area and that thence it
spread southwards into Italy, Greece, the Ægean, Egypt and
Asia, and northwards and westwards in Europe. At Noreia,
which gave its name to Noricum, less than forty miles from
Hallstatt, were the most famous iron mines of antiquity,
which produced the Noric swords so prized and dreaded by
the Romans. (See Pliny, <cite>Hist. Nat.</cite>, XXXIV, 145; Horace,
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epod.</span></cite>, 17&#160;: 71.) This iron needed no tempering and the
Celts had found it ready smelted by nature just as the Eskimos
had learned of themselves to use telluric iron embedded
in basalt.... The Hallstatt culture is that of the Homeric
Achæans (see Ridgeway, <cite>Early Age of Greece</cite>, pp. 407 <em>seq.</em>),
but as the brooch (along with iron, cremation of the dead,
the round shield and the geometric ornament), passed down
into Greece from central Europe, and as brooches are found
in the lower town at Mycenæ, 1350 B. C., they must have
been invented long before that date in central Europe. But
as they are found here in the late bronze and early iron age,
the early iron culture of Hallstatt must have originated long
before 1350 B. C., a conclusion in accordance with the absence
of silver at Hallstatt itself.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Keller, p. 160, describes an iron sword modelled after the
same pattern as those of bronze; Schenck, p. 341, mentions
a copper axe exactly like those of stone, and another of bronze
of very primitive pattern. These and numerous other examples
show the gradual growth of each age.</p>

<p class='c007'>The generally accepted date for Hallstatt is about 900 or
1000 B. C. Even Rice Holmes approves of this. (See 2,
p. 9.) But if we believe that iron spread from Hallstatt,
and it was in Etruria at 1200–1100 B. C., and in Greece, in
the form of swords like those of Hallstatt, at 1400 B. C.
(according to Ridgeway), together with pins and various
other objects which originated in the Tyrol, it is certainly
very conservative to place the appearance of iron in Austria
at 1500 B. C. Iron weapons were found in the remains
of Troy from the war of 1184 B. C. See Ridgeway,
<em>op. cit.</em>, and Lartiaux, p. 179.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may quote from Hoernes as follows regarding the dates:
“The temporal limits of the Hallstatt period are uncertain,
according to the districts which one includes and the phenomena
which one considers. It is now known that the Hallstatt
relics for the most part belong to the first half of the
last millennium B. C. But while some assign these relics as
from the time of perhaps 1200 to perhaps 500, others are
satisfied with the period from 900 to 400, or bring them even
farther forward. It is certain that one must differentiate in
these questions between the west and the east of the Hallstatt
culture areas; in the one the particular Hallstatt forms
would come nearer to the close than in the other. One or
perhaps more centuries lie between the first appearance of
the La Tène forms in Western Germany and in the eastern
Alps. Also the beginning varies according to the locality
and the criteria which one takes for a guide, that is to say,
according to whether the phenomena of the time about 1000
B. C. are considered as belonging still in the pure Bronze
Age, to a transition period, or indeed to the first Iron Age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>129&#160;: 26. Ridgeway, speaking of the Achæans, says:
“They brought with them iron which they used for their
long swords and cutting implements.... The culture of
the Homeric Achæans” (these are dated about 1000 B. C.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>about the time of the Dorians, according to Bury, p. 57)
“corresponds to a large extent with that of the early Iron
Age of the Upper Danube (Hallstatt) and to the early Iron
Age of Upper Italy (Villanova).”</p>

<p class='c007'>Myres, <cite>Dawn of History</cite>, p. 175, says that there was a
gradual introduction of iron, first for tools and then for
weapons. It had been known as “precious metal” in the
Ægean since the late Minoan third period, or even the late
Minoan second period, which is usually dated with the
XVIIIth Egyptian dynasty as about 1500–1350. Most other
writers, however, including Bury, p. 57, Myers, <cite>Anc. Hist.</cite>,
p. 136, and Deniker, <cite>Races of Man</cite>, p. 315, ascribe the general
use of iron to a much later invasion, namely that of the
Dorians, about 1100 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>129&#160;: 29. Iron swords of the Nordics. Ridgeway, 1, pp.
407 <em>seq.</em>: “Their chief weapon was a long iron sword; with
trenchant strokes delivered by these long swords the Celts
had dealt destruction to their foes on many a field. They
used not the thrust, as did the Greeks and Romans of the
classical period. This is put beyond doubt by Polybius
(II, 30) who in his account of the great defeat suffered by
the combined tribes of Transalpine Gæsatæ, Insubres, Boii
and Taurisci, when they invaded Italy in 225 B. C., tells us
that the Romans had the advantage in arms ‘for the Gallic
sword can only deliver a cut but cannot thrust.’ Again in
his account of the great victory gained over the Insubres
by the Romans in 223 B. C., the same historian tells us that
the defeat of the Celts was due to the fact that their long
iron swords easily bent, and could only give one downward
cut with any effect, but that after this the edges got so
turned and the blades so bent, that unless they had time to
straighten them out with the foot against the ground, they
could not deliver a second blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘When the Celts had rendered their swords useless by
the first blows delivered on the spears the Romans closed
with them and rendered them quite helpless by preventing
them from raising their hands to strike with their swords,
which is their peculiar and only stroke, because their blade
has no point. The Romans, on the contrary, having excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>points to their swords, used them not to cut but to thrust;
and by thus repeatedly smiting the breasts and faces of the
enemy, they eventually killed the greater number of them.’
(II, 33 and III.)”</p>

<p class='c007'>Further evidence in support of our contention that iron
was in use much earlier than is generally admitted, comes
from an unexpected quarter. J. N. Svoronos, in a recent
book on ancient Greek coinage, entitled <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Hellénism primitif
de la Macédoine, prouvé par la numismatique</span></cite>, p. 171, remarks:
“In the first place, indeed, it is forgotten that some of this
information, that which is derived from people of ‘mythical’
times, can be referred not only to the invention of the first
money struck in precious metal (gold, electrum, or silver),
but even to obelisks of iron, or to cast plinths in the form of
copper axes, which, of a determined weight, and legally
guaranteed by the state, constituted, already before the
XVth century, as we positively know at the present time, the
first legal money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>130&#160;: 24. The Iron Age in western Europe. Deniker, 2,
p. 315, says: “So also, according to Montelius, the introduction
of iron dates only from the fifth or third century B. C.
in Sweden, while Italy was acquainted with this metal as
far back as the twelfth century B. C. The civilization of
the ‘iron age,’ distributed over two periods, according to
the excavations made in the stations of Hallstatt (Austria)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>and La Tène (Switzerland), must have been imported from
central Europe into Greece through Illyria. The importation
corresponds perhaps with the Dorian invasion of the
Peloponnesus.... The Hallstattian civilization flourished
chiefly in Carinthia, southern Germany, Switzerland, Bohemia,
Silesia, Bosnia, the southeast of France and southern
Italy (the pre-Etruscan age of Montelius). The period which
followed, called the second, or iron age or the La Tène period,
was prolonged until the first century B. C. in France, Bohemia
and England. In Scandinavian countries the <em>first
iron age</em> lasted until the sixth century, and the <em>second iron
age</em> until the tenth century A. D.” Referring to the La Tène
period in a footnote, Deniker says: “This term, first used in
Germany, is accepted by almost all men of science. The
La Tène period corresponds pretty nearly with the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Âge
Marmien</span>’ of French archæologists and the ‘Late Celtic’ of
English archæologists. <em>Cf.</em> M. Hoernes, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Urgeschichte d.

<p class='c007'>Rice Holmes, 1, p. 231, remarks: “Iron in Britain is hardly
older than 500 B. C. (<em>i. e.</em> the earliest products of the British
iron age were traded in. See p. 229). In Gaul the Hallstatt
period is believed to have lasted from about 800 to about
400 B. C.” On p. 126: “It is certain that in the southeastern

<p class='c007'>The recent article by Parsons entitled “Anthropological
Observations on German Prisoners of War,” contains an interesting
reference, on p. 26, to the resurgence of Alpine
types in central Europe.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CHAPTER IV. THE ALPINE RACE</h4>

<p class='c015'>134&#160;: 1. There seem to have been at least three distinct
types of Alpines, one with a broad head and developed occiput
typical of western Europe, a second with a flat occiput
and a high crown, represented by such peoples as the Armenoids
of Asia Minor, and a third, of which little notice has
been taken, except by such men as Zaborowski (2) and
Fleure and James, pp. 137 <em>seq.</em> This third type is encountered
here and there in nests which “stretch at least from
southern Italy to Ireland, by way of the Straits of Gibraltar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>and across France by the dolmen line.” Fleure and James
may be quoted for the following discussion. “Questions
naturally arise as to the homologies of this type, and its distribution
beyond the line here mentioned. If we had the
type in Britain, by itself, we should be inclined to connect
it with the general population of Central Europe, the dark,
broad-headed Alpine type. We should, however, retain a
little hesitation about this, as our type is sometimes of extraordinary
strength of build and, while often fairly short,
it is occasionally outstandingly tall; moreover, the hair is
frequently quite black, and this is not on the whole an
Alpine character. But, when we note the coastal distribution
of this type, our hesitation is much increased, for the
Alpine type has spread typically along the mountain flanks
and its characteristic rarity in Britain is evidence of how
little it has followed the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We cannot but wonder also whether what Deniker calls
the Atlanto-Mediterranean type is not a result of averaging
these dark broad-heads with the true Mediterranean type.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Seeking further distributional evidence, we find that the
dark broad-heads are highly characteristic of Dalmatia and
may be an old-established stock, but it would appear that
this region is famous for the height of the heads there, and
our type is not specially high-headed. Broad-head brunets
do, however, occur farther east in Asia Minor, the Ægean,
and Crete, for example. Many are certainly hypsicephalic,
but in others it seems that the brow and head are moderate
and the forehead rather rectangular, as in our type....</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is interesting that there should be evidence of our dark
broad-heads beyond the Irish end of the line now discussed,
the line of intercourse which Déchellette thinks must be older
than the Bronze Age. The chief evidences for the type beyond
Ireland are:</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. Ripley (p. 309) shows that a dark, broad-headed element
is present in Shetland, West Caithness, and East
Sutherland. This is sometimes called the Old Black
Breed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. Arbo finds the coast and external openings of the
more southerly Norwegian fjords have a broad-headed population,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>whereas the inner ends of the fjords and the interior
are more dolichocephalic. The broad-heads stretch from
Trondhjemsfjord southward, and from their exclusively
coastwise distribution he supposes them to have come across
from the British Isles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The population is darker than the rest of Norway and
its area of distribution, as Dr. Stuart Mackintosh has kindly
pointed out to us, is, like that of the same type in the British
Isles, characterized by a pelagic climate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Luschan has fully discussed the Armenoid type in
his <cite>Early Inhabitants of Western Asia</cite>, and with E. Petersen,
in <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reisen in Lykien, Milyas, und Kibyratis</span></cite>. A special study
was made by Chantre in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recherches anthropologiques dans
l’Asie occidentale</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first type, then, the western European, has a short,
thick stature, round head, and rather light pigmentation;
the second, Armenoid, a rather tall stature, square, high
head, flat occiput, and dark pigmentation. The third, the
Old Black Breed, is rather small and dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to these we have a fourth type, which has been
called the Bronze Age race, or, better, the Beaker Maker
type (Borreby). This has been discussed by Greenwell and
Rolleston, Beddoe, and Keith, especially as to their possible
survivors at the present day; by Abercromby, in <cite>Bronze Age
Pottery</cite>; by Crawford, <cite>The Distribution of Early Bronze Age
Settlements in Britain</cite>; and by Peake, in a discussion of the
last work in the same number of the <cite>Geographical Journal</cite>.
Fleure and James describe it also. See the note to p. 138&#160;: 1
of this book.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further anthropological studies may simplify the problem
somewhat, but the author is now inclined to believe
that the above-mentioned third brachycephalic type, the
“Old Black Breed,” represents the survivors of the earliest
waves of the round-head invasion—in Britain antedating the
arrival of the Neolithic Mediterraneans, while the first type
mentioned above represents the descendants of the last
great Alpine expansion. This type in southern Germany
has been so thoroughly Nordicized in pigmentation that these
blond South Germans are sometimes discussed as though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>they were a distinct Alpine subspecies. The type is scantily
represented in England, and when found may be partly attributed
to ecclesiastics and other retainers brought over
by the Normans.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second of the above types, the Armenoids, are virtually
absent from Europe, and seem to be characteristic of eastern
Anatolia and the immediately adjacent regions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author regards the fourth, Borreby or Beaker Maker
type of tall, round heads as distinct from the three preceding
types. The distribution of their remains would indicate
they entered Britain from the northeast. We
have no clew as to their origin. A similar type is found in
the so-called Dinaric race of Deniker (which Fleure and James
mention in connection with the third type but hesitate to
class with it), which extends from the Tyrol along the mountainous
east coast of the Adriatic into Albania. Further
study of the Tripolje culture (see note to p. 143&#160;: 15) and the
mixture of population north of the Carpathians, where the
early Nordics and early Alpines came in contact, may throw
light on this question, as well as upon the problem of the
acquisition of Aryan languages by the Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these four round skulled types seem to have been of
West Asiatic origin, but their relationship to each other and
to the true Mongols of central Asia is as yet undetermined.
One thing is certain, that the Alpine Slavs north and east of
the Carpathians, and, to a less degree, the inhabitants of
Hungary and Bulgaria, have in their midst a very considerable
Mongoloid element, which has entered Europe since the
beginning of our era.</p>

especially its central region, was for ages the great recruiting
ground of mercenary soldiers, it is probable that the tall,
blond, long-headed element would emigrate at a more rapid
rate than the brown, short-headed one. In this way may
also be accounted for the apparent decline in the stature of
the modern Swiss, who certainly do not, as a rule, now justify
the descriptions given of their huge physical development
in earlier days, the days of halberds, morgensterns and two-handed
swords.” These mercenaries were Teutonic, but their
Celtic predecessors were addicted to the same habit as G.
Dottin has shown on p. 257 of his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel Celtique</span></cite>: “When
the Celts could not battle on their own account or against
their neighbors, they offered their services for the price of
silver to foreign kings. There is hardly a country that was
not overrun with Celtic mercenaries, nor struggles in which
they had not taken part. As far back as 368 B. C. an army
sent by Denys, the Ancient, to Corinth to aid the Spartiates,
was in part formed of Celtic foot soldiers.”</p>

Keane, 1, p. 150; Rice Holmes, 1, pp. 194, 441; Ripley,
pp. 308–309. Holmes suggests that the Beaker Makers may
have come from Denmark. Compare this theory with that
expressed by Fleure and James, pp. 128 <em>seq.</em> and 135; and
by Abercromby, Crawford and Peake as given there. The
Beaker Makers are quite fully discussed on pp. 86–88, 117,
128 <em>seq.</em>, and 135–137, in the article by Fleure and James. See
also Greenwell, <cite>British Barrows</cite>, pp. 627–718, and J. P. Harrison,
<cite>On the Survival of Certain Racial Features in the Population
of the British Isles</cite>. Fleure and James describe the
type as follows on p. 136: “With the beakers have long been
associated the broad-headed, strong-browed type, long known
to archæologists as the Bronze Age race, but better called
the ‘Beaker Makers,’ or Borreby type, for we now think that
these people reached Britain without a knowledge of bronze....
The general description of them is that they must
have been taller than the Neolithic British, averaging 5
feet 7 inches, rather strongly built, with long forearms and
inclined to roughness of feature. The head was broad
(skull index over 80, often 82 or more) and the supraciliary
arches strong, but very distinctly separated in most cases
by a median depression, and thus strongly contrasted with
the continuous supraciliary ridges of <em>e. g.</em>, Neanderthal
man&#160;... Keith&#160;... thinks it [the type] was usually
brown to fair in colouring at all periods, and this seems to
be a very general opinion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>138&#160;: 3. Beddoe, 4, p. 16: “On the whole, however, we
cannot be far wrong in describing the British skulls of the
bronze period as distinctly brachycephalic; and this seems
to have been the case in Scotland as well as in England (see
D. Wilson, <cite>Archæological and Prehistoric Annals</cite>, pp. 168–171).
Whencesoever they came, the men of the British
bronze race were richly endowed, physically. They were, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>a rule, tall and stalwart, their brains were large and their
features, if somewhat harsh and coarse, must have been
manly and even commanding. The chieftain of Gristhorpe,
whose remains are in the Museum of York, must have looked
a true king of men with his athletic frame, his broad forehead,
beetling brows, strong jaws and aquiline profile.”</p>

sea of Pontus are the abodes of the Bulgares, well known from
the disaster our neglect has brought upon us. From this
region, the Huns, like a fruitful root of bravest races, sprouted
into two hordes of people. Some of these are called Altziagiri,
others, Sabiri; and they have different dwelling places.
The Altziagiri are near Cherson, where the avaricious traders
bring in the goods of Asia. In summer they range the
plains, their broad domains, wherever the pasturage for their
cattle invites them, and betake themselves in winter beyond
the sea of Pontus. Now the Hunuguri are known to us
from the fact that they trade in marten skins. But they
have been cowed by their bolder neighbors.” Also on the
Hunuguri see Zeuss, p. 712.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>40; and A. Lefèvre, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Germains et Slavs</span></cite>, p. 156. Minns, in an
article on the Slavs, says: “Pliny (N. H., IV, 97) is the first
to give the Slavs a name which can leave us in no doubt.
He speaks of the Venedi (<em>cf.</em> Tacitus, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Germania</span></cite>, 46, Veneti);
Ptolemy (<cite>Geog.</cite>, III, 5, 7, 8) calls them Venedæ and puts
them along the Vistula and by the Venedic Gulf, by which
he seems to mean the Gulf of Danzig; he also speaks of the
Venedic mountains to the south of the sources of the Vistula,
that is, probably the northern Carpathians. The name
Venedæ is clearly Wend, the name that the Germans have
always applied to the Slavs. Its meaning is unknown. It
has been the cause of much confusion because of the Armorican
Veneti, the Paphlagonian Enetæ, and above all the
Enetæ-Venetæ at the head of the Adriatic.... Other
names in Ptolemy which almost certainly denote Slavic
tribes are the Veltæ on the Baltic. The name Slav first occurs
in Pseudo-Cæsarius (Dialogues, II, 110; Migne, P. G.,
XXXVIII, 985, early 6th century), but the earliest definite
account of them under that name is given by Jordanes
(Getica [<cite>History of the Goths</cite>], V, 34, 35), about 550 A. D.:
‘Within these rivers lies Dacia, encircled by the Alps as by
a crown. Near their left ridge, which inclines toward the
north, and beginning at the source of the Vistula, the populous
race of the Venethi dwell, occupying a great expanse
of land. Though their names are now dispersed amid various
clans and places, yet they are chiefly called Sclaveni and
Antes. The abode of the Sclaveni extends from the city of
Noviodunum and the lake called Mursianus, to the Dnâster,
and northward as far as the Vistula. They have swamps
and forests for their cities. The Antes, who are the bravest
of these peoples dwelling in the curve of the sea of Pontus,
spread from the Dnâster to the Dnâper, rivers that are
many days’ journey apart.’” See also Zaborowski, 1, pp.
272 <em>seq.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>The name <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wends</span></i>, as has been said, was used by the Germans
to designate the Slavs. It is now used for the Germanized
Polaks, and especially for the Lusatian Wends or Sorbs.
It is first found in English used by Alfred. Canon I. Taylor,
in <cite>Words and Places</cite>, p. 42, says: “The Sclavonians call themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>either <i><span lang="cu" xml:lang="cu">Slowjane</span></i>, ‘the intelligible men,’ or else <i><span lang="cu" xml:lang="cu">Srb</span></i>
which means ‘kinsmen,’ while the Germans call them
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wends</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Haddon, 3, p. 47, says: “The Slavs, who belong to the
Alpine race, seem to have had their area of characterization
in Poland and the country between the Carpathians and the
Dnieper; they may be identified with the Venedi.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the author’s opinion these people have, so far as is
known, nothing whatever to do with the tribe of Veneti at
the head of the Adriatic, nor with the Veneti in western
Europe in what is now Brittany. Of the former Ripley, p.
258, says that they have been generally accepted as of Illyrian
derivation and cites D’Arbois de Jubainville, Von
Duhn, Pigorini, Sergi, Pullé, Moschen and Tedeschi as
authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Veneti in Italy are tall, broad-headed and some
are blond, having mixed with the Teutons. They possessed
some eastern habits, such as their marriage customs, as set
forth in Herodotus. They were flourishing, wealthy and
peaceful. Later they were driven to what is now Venice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Veneti in Gaul were a powerful maritime people, who
carried on a sea trade with Britain. Strangely, perhaps, the
ancient name of northern Wales was Venedotia. The name
Veneto, however, has nothing to do with that of Vandal.
For some theories as to the relationships of some of these
Veneti, see Zaborowski, 3.</p>

<p class='c007'>143&#160;: 15. Gallicia and the Tripolje Culture. <em>Cf.</em> pp.
113–114. Gallicia is not far from the known location of the
Brünn-Prêdmost race, which was <em>dolichocephalic with a long
face</em>. This early appearance of a dolichocephalic race at the
point where the dolichocephalic Nordics later came in contact
with the Alpines is very significant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The locality is in the neighborhood of the Tripolje area in
southern Russia, for which see Minns, <cite>Scythians and Greeks</cite>,
pp. 130–142, and Peake, 2, p. 164.</p>

<p class='c007'>Minns says: “The first finds of Neolithic settlements in
Russia were made near the village of Tripolje, on the Dnêpr,
forty miles below Kiev, and this name has since been extended
to the culture of a large area in southern Russia. The remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>consist of so-called ‘areas’ with buildings which had
wattled, clay-covered walls which were fired when dry to
give them greater hardness. Pottery is present in great
abundance and variety of forms. These bear painted decorations
which are very artistic. There are a few figurines.
The buildings were not dwellings but probably chapels.
The homes were probably pit dwellings. Bodies of the dead
were incinerated and deposited in urns.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The theory has been abandoned that this was an autochthonous
development, typical of the Indo-Europeans [Nordics]
before they differentiated (<em>cf.</em> Chvojka, the first discoverer).
Although similar to Ægean art this was earlier
(see Von Stern, <cite>Prehistoric Greek Culture in the South of
Russia</cite>). It came suddenly to an end and had no successor
in that region. The people were agriculturalists long before
the Scythians, but the next people who lived there were thorough
nomads. Niederle (<cite>Slav. Ant.</cite>, I) dates them 2000
B. C. The Tripolje people either moved south or were
overwhelmed by new comers.” As Peake says, 2, pp. 164–165,
here was a very likely point of contact between the Nordic
and Alpine stocks, a mixture which, in the opinion of the
author, may ultimately throw some light on the origin of
the Dinaric and Beaker Maker types. Through this region
both Alpines and Nordics must have passed many times in
their wanderings. Here perhaps the Alpines became partly
Nordicized, especially as to their language.</p>

<p class='c007'>143&#160;: 21. Sarmatians. There has been considerable confusion
over these people, owing to the various ways in which
the name has been spelled by early and later writers, and to
the fact that they dwelt in the region where both Alpines
and Nordics must have existed side by side. The name Sarmatians
has been applied at one time to Nordics, at another
to Alpines or even Mongolians, depending on the dates when
they were discussed and the bias of various writers. We
have no generic name for the Alpine peoples who must have
been in this region in early times, except that of Sarmatians
or Scythians. As the Scythians are apparently strongly
Nordic in character, the name Sarmatians seemed more fitting
to apply to the Alpine tribes who were certainly there.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Not all authorities are agreed as to their affiliations, however,
as has been said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jordanes declares that the Sarmatians and the Sauromatæ
were the same people. Stephanus Byzantius states that
the Syrmatæ were identical with the Sauromatæ. They are
first mentioned by Polybius as being in Europe in 179 B. C.
(XXV, II; XXVI, VI, 12). But in Asia we hear of them as
early as 325 B. C., according to Minns, p. 38, who says that
they gradually shifted westward, until in 50 A. D. they
were in the Danube valley. Jordanes later speaks of the
Carpathian mountains as the Sarmatian range. Mierow,
in the notes to his translation of Jordanes, makes the Sarmatians
a great Slavic people dwelling from the Vistula to
the Don, in what is now Poland and Russia. (See also
Hodgkin, <cite>Italy</cite>, vol. I, part I, p. 71.) According to Jordanes,
the Sarmatians were beyond Dacia (the ancient Gothic land)
and to the north (XII, 74). It is with these statements in
mind that the author has designated them as Alpines.</p>

<p class='c007'>Minns describes the Sarmatians as nomads of the Caspian
steppes who wore armor like the Hiung-nu. About
325 B. C. there was a decline of the Scyths and they appear.
During the second and third centuries A. D. was the time
when they spread over the vast regions from Hungary to the
Caspian. Minns, however, is firm in the belief that they
were Iranians [Nordics], like the Alans, Ossetes, Jasy, etc.
In the second half of the fourth century B. C. they were still
east of the Don or just crossing; for the next century and a
half we have very scanty knowledge of what was happening
in the steppes. Procopius, III, II, also makes them
Goths. (See the note to p. 66&#160;: 16.) Feist, 5, p. 391, quotes
Tacitus as to their being horse-loving nomads of south
Russia. See also D’Arbois de Jubainville, 4, t. I, and Gibbon,
chaps. XVIII, XXV, etc., for further discussions.</p>

Old Bulgaria, according to Pruner-Bey, 2, t. I, pp. 399–433,
P. F. Kanitz and others, seems to have been between the
Ural mountains and the Volga. The old Bulgarians were a
Finnic tribe (just which is a matter of much dispute). They
crossed the Danube toward the end of the seventh century.

<p class='c007'>145&#160;: 19. Of the numerous tribes who, since the Christian
Era, have entered Europe and Anatolia from western Asia
some were undoubtedly pure Mongoloids, like the Huns of
Attila, or the hordes of Genghis Khan. Others were probably
under Mongoloid leaders, and included a large proportion
of West Asiatic Alpines (<em>i. e.</em>, Turcomans), while still others
may have been substantially Alpines. The Mongols in their

them many of the tribes of western Asia, or perhaps more
often would drive the latter ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>147&#160;: 7 <em>seq.</em> Accad and Sumer. Prince, and Zaborowski
(after de Sarzec) give the earliest date of Accad as about
3800 B. C., but Prince thinks this date too old by 700–1000
years. See also Zaborowski, 1, pp. 118–125. H. R. Hall, in
<cite>The Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, reviews the entire work
in this field in his first chapter. According to him, dates in
Babylonia can be traced as far back as those of Egypt,
without coming to a time when there was no writing or metal,
while Egyptian records begin in a Neolithic culture. The
earliest dates so far established are in the fourth millennium
B. C., but already a high degree of civilization had been
reached there or elsewhere by people who brought it to
Babylonia. Hall, p. 176, says: “The most ancient remains
that we find in the city mounds are Sumerian. The site of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>the ancient Shurripak, at Fârah in Southern Babylonia, has
lately been excavated. The culture revealed by this excavation
is Sumerian, and metal-using, even at the lowest levels.
The Sumerians apparently knew the use of copper at the
beginning of their occupation of Babylonia, and no doubt
brought this knowledge with them.” See chap. V of Hall’s
book, and the two great works of King, the <cite>Chronicles Concerning
the Early Babylonian Kings</cite>, and <cite>The History of Sumer
and Akkad</cite>, as well as Rogers’s <cite>History of Babylonia and Assyria</cite>.
In his preface to the first mentioned of his two works
King states that the new researches are resulting in a tendency
to reduce the dates of these ancient empires very considerably,
especially for the dynasties. Thus for Su-abu, the
founder of the first dynasty, a date not earlier than 2100
B. C. is now given, and for Hammurabi one not earlier than
the twentieth century B. C. Accad is by many authors, including
Breasted, considered to have been Semitic from the
beginning, and to have been established about 2800 B. C.
But Zaborowski claims that it was not originally Semitic, but
Semitized at a very early date. He makes both city-kingdoms
originally Turanian [by which he means Alpine and
pre-Aryan] with an agglutinative language related to the
Altaic. See also Zaborowski, 2. He dates the cuneiform inscriptions
between 3700 and 4000 B. C., after de Sarzec and
de Morgan. Hall draws attention to the remarkable resemblance
of the Sumerians to the Dravidians, and is inclined
to believe that they may have come from India.
Both G. Elliot Smith and Breasted claim the Babylonians
derived their culture from Egypt, but the weight of evidence
is gradually accumulating against them. See Hall,
chap. V. The relations of the two regions and Egyptian
dates are treated in Reisner’s <cite>Early Dynastic Cemeteries of
Naga-ed-Dêr</cite>; and Eduard Meyer, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte des Altertums</span></cite>,
should also be consulted. Against these Egyptologists are
most of the later writers, such as Hall and King and many
others. The location of Babylonia is a fact distinctly in
favor of its earlier beginnings. There is no denying the very
remote origin of Egyptian culture, which in its isolation for
so many centuries had ample time to develop its own peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>features and to become sufficiently strong to later extend a
very wide influence. There is an interesting study of the
fauna of Egypt by Lortet and Gaillard, which proves that
much of it was originally African, not Asiatic, as those who
wish to prove the opposite theory, that Egyptian culture was
derived from the east in very remote times, have endeavored
to establish. There is no doubt that the Egyptians were
sufficiently plastic and adaptable in the earlier centuries of
their development, wherever they may have come from, to
make use of what the continent of Africa contributed in the
way of resources. (See also Gaillard, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Tatonnements des
Égyptiens</span></cite>, etc., and H. H. Johnston, <cite>On North African Animals</cite>.)
To claim that the civilization of Sumer was derived
directly from Elam, which in turn obtained its earliest culture
from Egypt, is, in the opinion of the author, to reverse
the truth. Some authorities believe that Elam was the
origin from which came the civilization found by Pumpelly
in Turkestan, and believed by him to have been not earlier
than the end of the third millennium B. C. (For a further
reference to this see the note to p. 119&#160;: 15 of this book, on
Balkh.)</p>

<p class='c007'>See Hall as to the relationship of the Accadians and Sumerians
with Elam. Zaborowski says they were all of the same
Alpine stock, that is, the very early Sumerians and Accadians
and Elamites. See 2, p. 411. For Susa, Elam and Media,
see <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les peuples Aryens</span></cite>, pp. 125–138, and Hall, chap. V.
For the Persians, Zaborowski, 1, pp. 134 <em>seq.</em> Ripley, pp.
417, 449–450, discusses some of the eastern tribes, among
them the Tadjiks, whom general opinion makes round skulled.
These, according to Zaborowski, are the living
prototypes of the Susians, Elamites and Medes. Many
writers consider the Medes to have been Nordics and related
to the Persians. The author, however, follows Zaborowski
in classing them as the early brachycephalic population of
Elam or its highlands or plateau, which was conquered by
the Persians. On the Medes and Media see the notes to
p. 254&#160;: 13.</p>

Frank, <cite>Roman Imperialism</cite>. Giuffrida-Ruggeri, in <cite>A Sketch
of the Anthropology of Italy</cite>, p. 101, says of the composition
of the population of Rome: “The three fundamental European
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>races, <em>H. mediterraneus</em>, <em>H. alpinus</em>, and <em>H. nordicus</em>, had their
representatives among the ancient Romans, although the
skeletal remains of the Mediterraneans and the Northerners
are difficult to distinguish from each other. It is also possible
that the Northerners belonged to the aristocrats who
preferred to burn their dead. In the calm tenacity and quiet
growth of the Roman people perhaps the descendants of <em>H.
nordicus</em> represented the turbulent restlessness of violent and
bold individuals which, even in Roman history, one is able
to discern from time to time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection it is interesting to note what Charles
W. Gould has said on p. 117, in <cite>America, a Family Matter</cite>,
concerning Sulla. He describes him as follows: “Even during
the terror Sulla found time for enjoyment. Tawny hair,
piercing blue eyes, fair complexion readily suffused with color
as emotion and red blood surged within, Norseman that he
was, he presided over constant and splendid entertainments,
taking more pleasure in a witty actor than in the degenerate
men and women of the old nobility who elbowed their way
in.” Also see the notes to p. 215&#160;: 21.</p>

<p class='c007'>154&#160;: 5. Quarrels between the Patricians and the Plebs.
See Tenney Frank, <cite>Roman Imperialism</cite>, pp. 5 <em>seq.</em>, for a discussion
of the mixture of races, “only we cannot agree that
a social state can accomplish race amalgamation. The two
races are still there.” Boni, <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Notizie degli Scavi</span></cite>, vol. III p.
401, believes that the Patricians were the descendants of the
immigrant Aryans, while the Plebeians were the offspring of
the aboriginal Non-Aryan stock. Compare this with the
statements of early writers concerning the conditions in
Gaul, especially as summed up by Dottin in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel
Celtique</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank says, concerning the quarrels, in chap. II, <em>op. cit.</em>:
“Roman tradition preserved in the first book of Livy presents
a very circumstantial account of the several battles by which
Rome supposedly razed the Latin cities one after another....
Needless to say, if the Latin tribe had lived in such
civil discord as the legend assumes, it would quickly have
succumbed to the inroads of the mountain tribes.” Thus
probably the quarrels between Latin and Etruscan have
been overrated. See again, p. 14, for the oriental origin of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>some intruding people. He says, in a note at the end of
the chapter: “Ridgeway, in <cite>Who were the Romans</cite>, 1908,
has ably, though not convincingly developed the view that
the Patricians were Sabine conquerors. Cuno, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorgeschichte
Roms</span></cite>, I, 14, held that they were Etruscans. Fustel de Coulanges,
in his well-known work, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La cité antique</span></cite>, proposed the
view that a religious caste system alone could explain the
division. Eduard Meyer, the article on the Plebs in <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Handwörterbuch
der Staatswissenschaften</span></cite>, and Botsford, <cite>Roman
Assemblies</cite>, p. 16, have presented various arguments in favor
of the economic theory. See Binder, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Plebs</span></cite>, 1909, for a
summary of many other discussions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Breasted, <cite>Ancient Times</cite>, pp. 495 <em>seq.</em>, and Sir Harry Johnston,
<cite>Views and Reviews</cite>, p. 97, are two who have touched

p. 81. D’Arbois de Jubainville, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Celts en Espagne</span></cite>, XIV,
p. 369, says in describing a combat between P. Cornelius
Scipio and a Gallic warrior: “Scipio was of very small stature,
the Celtiberian warrior with the high stature which in all
times in the tales of the Roman historians characterizes the
Celtic race; and the beginning of the struggle gave him the
advantage.” Taylor, <cite>Origin of the Aryans</cite>, p. 76, says:
“The stature of the Celts struck the Romans with astonishment.
Cæsar speaks of their <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirifica corpora</span></i> and contrasts
the short stature of the Romans with the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnitudo corporum</span></i>
of the Gauls. Strabo, also, speaking of the Coritavi, a
British tribe in Lincolnshire, after mentioning their yellow
hair, says: ‘To show how tall they are, I saw myself some of
their young men at Rome and they were taller by six inches
than anyone else in the city.’” See also Elton, <cite>Origins</cite>,

there a Carthaginian army in the ranks of which marched
auxiliaries furnished by the Celtic peoples of Spain; Roman
troops came to combat this army and four years after the
departure of Hannibal, (<em>i. e.</em> in 214), they gave many battles
to the Carthaginian generals where the Celts were vanquished.
In the booty there were found abundant Gallic
trappings, especially a great number of collars and bracelets
of gold; among the dead of the Carthaginian army left upon
the plain were two petty Gallic kings, Moencapitus and Vismarus.
Livy, who tells us these things, says distinctly that
the trappings were Gallic (Gallica) and that the kings were
Gallic. See Livy, I, XXIV, c. 42.”</p>

<p class='c007'>157&#160;: 6. See p. 122 for the predominance of the Mediterraneans.</p>

<p class='c007'>157&#160;: 10. Umbrians and Oscans. It is fair to assume that
some people brought the Aryan languages into Italy from the
north, and this introduction is credited to the Umbrians and
Oscans. (See Helbig, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Italiker in der Poebene</span></cite>, pp. 29–41;
Ridgeway, <cite>Early Age of Greece</cite>; Conway, <cite>Early Italic Dialects</cite>.)
The Umbrians and Oscans were closely allied in regard to
their language, whatever may have been their ethnic affinities.
In a remoter degree they were connected with the
Latins. From the time and starting-point of their migrations,
as well as from their type of culture, it would appear
that they were cognate with the early Nordic invaders of
Greece. Whether they were wholly Nordic, or were thoroughly
Nordicized Alpines, or merely Alpines with Nordic
leaders is not of particular moment in this connection, but
if they were the carriers of Aryan language and culture they
were Nordicized in a degree comparable to the genuine Nordics
who invaded Greece. Giuffrida-Ruggeri, in one of the
latest papers on Italy, as well as many earlier authorities,
regards the Umbrians as Alpines, but he says they were not
all round skulled. “The Osci, the Sabines, the Samnites,
and other Sabellic peoples were Aryans or Aryanized, although
they inhumated their dead instead of burning them.
It is possible that the founders of Rome consisted of both
families, as we find both rites in ancient Rome” (p. 100).</p>

<p class='c007'>157&#160;: 14. Etruscans. The author is familiar with the
persistent theory that the Etruscans came from Asia Minor
by sea, but he nevertheless regards them as indigenous inhabitants
of Italy, that is, the Pre-Aryan, Pre-Nordic Mediterraneans,
who, as part of a large and extended group, were
spread over a great part of the shores of the Mediterranean,
and were at that time the Italian exponents of the prevailing
Ægean culture. During the second millennium in which this
culture flourished, they were much influenced by Crete, although
they developed their civilization along special lines.
The Etruscan language, excluding the borrowed elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>from later Italic dialects, is apparently in no sense Aryan.

<p class='c007'>157&#160;: 16. The date 800 is given by Feist, 5, p. 370.</p>

<p class='c007'>157&#160;: 18. Livy, V, 33 <em>seq.</em>, is the authority for the date of
the sixth century. See also Polybius, 1, II, c. XVII, § 1.

in Italy about the fifth century B. C. Most authorities follow
Livy.</p>

also, among the aristocracy.</p>

<p class='c007'>158&#160;: 1 <em>seq.</em> An interesting discussion of this event is
given by Salomon Reinach, 2. The invasion was resisted
first at Thermopylæ and later at Delphi. On p. 81 Reinach
says: “In the detailed recital which Pausanius has left us
of the invasion of the Galatic bands in Greece, dealing with
the glorious part which the Athenians played in the defence
of the Pass of Thermopylæ. But, when the defile had
been forced, the Athenians departed and Pausanius makes
no more mention of them in relating the defence of Delphi,
where only the Phocians, four hundred Locrians and two
hundred Ætolians figured. It is only after the defeat of the
Gauls that the Athenians, according to Pausanius, came back,
together with the Bœotians, to harass the barbarians in
their retreat....” On p. 83 he says: “The barbarians are
incontestably the Galatians.” See also by the same author,
<cite>The Gauls in Antique Art</cite>. G. Dottin, pp. 461–462 gives us the
following: “Hannibal, traversing southern Gaul, found on
his passage only Gauls. On the other hand, Livy mentions
the arrival of Gauls in Provence at the same time as their
first descent into Italy, and Justinius places the wars of the
Greeks of Marseilles against the Gauls and Ligurians before
the taking of Rome by the Gauls. The invasion of the
Belgæ is placed then in the third century. It is doubtless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>contemporaneous with the Celtic invasion of Greece which
was perhaps caused by it.” See also the notes to p. 174&#160;: 21
of this book. According to Myers, <cite>Ancient History</cite>, where
the account of these events is briefly given on pp. 269–270,
the year was 278 B. C. Breasted, 1, p. 449, gives 280 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>As late as the fourth century of our era, Celtic forms of
speech prevailed among the Galatians of Asia Minor. According
to Jerome (Fraser’s <cite>Golden Bough</cite>, II, p. 126, footnote),
the language spoken then in Anatolia was very similar
to the dialect of the Treveri, a Celtic tribe on the Moselle,
of whose name Treves is the perpetuator. “It was to these
people that St. Paul addressed one of his epistles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to note that at the present time the finest
soldiers of the Turkish army are recruited in the district of
Angora which includes the territory of ancient Galatia.</p>

<p class='c007'>158&#160;: 13. Procopius, IV, 13, says that a number of Moors
and their wives took refuge in Sicily and also in Sardinia
where they established colonies. The recent article by
Giuffrida-Ruggeri sums up the data for Sicily, Sardinia and
Corsica. See also Gibbon, <em>passim</em>, and Ripley, pp. 115–116.</p>

pp. 127&#160;: 26 and 128.</p>

<p class='c007'>158&#160;: 21. Pelasgians. Sergi, 4, followed by many anthropologists,
describes as Pelasgian one branch of the Mediterranean
or Eurafrican race of mankind and one group of
skull types within that race. Ripley, pp. 407, 448, considers
them Mediterraneans in all probability, as this is the oldest
layer of population in these regions. So also do Myres,
<cite>Dawn of History</cite>, p. 171, and most of the other authorities.
In his <cite>History of the Pelasgian Theory</cite>, Myres sums up all
that was written up to that time. Homer and other early
writers make them the ancient inhabitants of Greece, who
were subdued by the Hellenes. It is generally agreed that
a people resembling in its prevailing skull forms the Mediterranean
race of north Africa was settled in the Ægean area
from a remote Neolithic antiquity. D’Arbois de Jubainville,
4, t. I, devotes a chapter or more to them, and declares
on p. 110: “In fact the Pelasgians and the Hellenes are of
different origin; the first are one of the races which preceded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>the Indo-Europeans in Europe, the others are Indo-European.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another recent writer who deals with this puzzling problem
is Sartiaux, in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Troie</span></cite>, pp. 140–143. Finally, Sir William
Ridgeway says: “The Achæans found the land occupied
by a people known by the ancients as Pelasgians who continued
down to classical times the main element in the population,
even in the states under Achæan, and later, under Dorian
rule. In some cases the Pelasgians formed a serf class, <em>e. g.</em>
in Penestæ, in Thessaly, the Helots in Laconia and the Gymnesii
at Argos; whilst they practically composed the whole
population of Arcadia and Attica which never came under
either Achæan or Dorian rule. This people had dwelt in the
Ægean from the Stone Age, and though still in the Bronze
Age at the Achæan conquest, had made great advances in
the useful and ornamental arts. They were of short stature,
with dark hair and eyes, and generally dolichocephalic.
Their chief centers were at Cnossus, Crete, in Argolis, Laconia
and Attica, in each being ruled by ancient lines of
kings. In Argolis, Prœtus built Tiryns but later under
Perseus, Mycenæ took the lead until the Achæan conquest.
All the ancient dynasties traced their descent from Poseidon,
who at the time of the Achæan conquest was the chief male
divinity of Greece and the islands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the Pelasgian being a Non-Aryan tongue, the ancient
script at Crete has not yet been deciphered. Since the ancient
Cretans were presumably Pelasgians, it is safe to identify
them with this Non-Aryan language, although Conway,
2, pp. 141–142, is inclined to believe that it is related to the
Aryan family. See also Sweet, <cite>The History of Language</cite>, p.
103.</p>

<p class='c007'>158&#160;: 22. Nordic Achæans. Ridgeway, 1, p. 683, says:
“We found that a fair-haired race greater in stature than the
melanochroous Ægean people had there [in Greece and the
Ægean] been domiciled for long ages, and that fresh bodies
of tall, fair-haired people from the shores of the northern
ocean continually through the ages had kept pressing down
into the southern peninsulas. From this it followed that the
Achæans of Homer were one of these bodies of Celts [<em>i. e.</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Nordics], who had made their way down into Greece and
had become the masters of the indigenous race.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This conclusion we further tested by an examination of
the distribution of the round shield, the practise of cremation,
the use of the brooch and buckle, and finally the diffusion of
iron in Europe, North Africa and western Asia. Our inductions
showed that all four had made their way into Greece
and the Ægean from Central Europe. Accordingly as they
all appeared in Greece along with the Homeric Achæans, we
inferred that the latter had brought them with them from
central Europe.” Elsewhere, in the same book, Ridgeway
identifies the Homeric age with the Achæan and Post-Mycenæan,
the Mycenæan with the Pre-Achæan and Pelasgian.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bury, <cite>The History of Greece</cite>, p. 44, says: “The Achæans
were a people of blond complexion, of Indo-European speech.
Among the later Greeks, there were two marked types, distinguished
by light and dark hair. The blond complexion
was rarer and more prized. This is illustrated by the fact
that women and fops used sometimes to dye their hair yellow
or red, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κομης ξανθίσματα</span> mentioned in the Danæ of Euripedes.”</p>

many others, among them Von Luschan. See also Myres,
<cite>The Dawn of History</cite>, pp. 173 <em>seq.</em> and 213. While this may
be partially true even of the bulk of the population, all the
tribes to the north of the Mediterranean fringe carried a

<p class='c007'>162&#160;: 14. Alexander the Great. Descriptions of Alexander
are found in Plutarch, who quotes the memoirs of
Aristoxenus, a contemporary of Alexander, regarding the
agreeable odor exhaled from his skin; Plutarch also says,
without giving his authority, who was probably the same,
that Alexander was “fair and of a light color, passing to
ruddiness in his face and upon his breast.” An authority
for the statement of blue and black eyes is Quintus Curtius
Rufus, a Roman historian of the first century A. D., in <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historiarum
Alexandri Magni, Libri Decem</span></cite>. This was written
three and one-half centuries after the death of Alexander.
The quotation, from North’s translation of Plutarch, reads:
“But when Appeles painted Alexander holding lightning in
his hand he did not shew his fresh color, but made him somewhat
blacke and swarter than his face in deede was; for
naturally he had a very fayre white colour, mingled also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>with red which chiefly appeared in his face and in his
brest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Gabon’s <cite>Inquiries into the Human Faculty</cite>, original English

case with the modern ‘Greeks’ in Asia. I have notes for
580 adults, males and females. In this number there were
8 with blue and 29 with gray or greenish eyes; all the rest
had brown eyes. There was not one case of really light colored
hair, but in nearly all the cases of lighter eyes the
hair also was less dark than with the other Greeks.” See

<p class='c007'>164&#160;: 12. On p. 57 of his <cite>History of Greece</cite> Bury inclines
to the belief that the Dorians came through Epirus, and attributes
the cause of their invasion to the pressure of the
Illyrians, to whom the Dorians were probably related. It is
known that the Illyrians were round-headed. Finally they
left the regions of the Corinthian Gulf, and sailed around the
Peloponnesus to southeast Greece, where they settled, leaving
only a few Dorians behind, who gave their name to the
country they occupied, but ever afterward were of no consequence
in Greek history. Some bands went to Crete,
others on other islands and some to Asia Minor.</p>

says that there is “a tacit assumption that as the east is the
probable quarter in which either the human species or the
greater part of our civilization originated, everything came
from it. But surely in this there is a confusion between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>primary diffusion of mankind over the world at large and
those secondary movements by which, according to even

Zaborowski, 1, pp. 137–138. For a lengthy discussion of them
and of their migrations, and of their possible affiliations with
the Cimbri, see Ridgeway, 1, pp. 387–397. According to the
best Assyriologists the Cimmerians are the same people who,
known as the Gimiri or Gimirrai, according to cuneiform inscriptions,
were in Armenia in the eighth century B. C.
See Hall, <cite>Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, p. 495. Bury,
<cite>History of Greece</cite>, also touches on their raids in Asia Minor.
Minns, p. 115, believes them to have been Scythians. G.
Dottin, p. 23 and elsewhere, speaking of the Cimmerians and
Cimbri, says: “The latter are without doubt Germans, therefore
the Cimmerians who are the same people are not ancestors
of the Celts.” The Cimmerians were first spoken
of by Homer (Odyssey, XI, 12–19) who describes them as
living in perpetual darkness in the far North. Herodotus
(IV, 11–13) in his account of Scythia, regards them as the
early inhabitants of south Russia, after whom the Bosphorus
Cimmerius and other places were named, and who were
driven by the Scyths along the Caucasus into Asia Minor,
where they maintained themselves for a century. The
Cimmerii are often mentioned in connection with the Thracian
Treres who made their raids across the Hellespont,
and possibly some of them took this route, having been cut
off by the Scyths as the Alani were by the Huns. Certain
it is that in the middle of the seventh century B. C., Asia
Minor was ravaged by northern nomads (Herodotus, IV, 12),
one body of whom is called in Assyrian sources Gimirrai
and is represented as coming through the Caucasus. They
were Aryan-speaking, to judge by the few proper names preserved.
To the north of the Euxine their main body was
merged finally with the Scyths. Later writers have often
confused them with the Cimbri of Jutland. There is no relation
between the Cimbri and the Cymbry or Cymry, a
word derived from the Welsh Combrox and used by them to
denote their own people. See note to p. 174&#160;: 26</p>

<p class='c007'>173&#160;: 18. The Nordics cross the Rhine into Gaul. Rice
Holmes, 2, pp. 11–12, gives the seventh century B. C. as the
date when tall fair Celts first crossed the Rhine westward,
“but it is unlikely that they were homogeneous....
Physically they resembled the tall fair Germans whom Cæsar
and Tacitus describe, but they differed from them in character
and customs as well as in speech.” See also p. 336, at
the bottom, where he remarks: “Early in the Hallstatt period
a tall dolichocephalic race appeared in the Jura and the Doubs,
who may have been the advanced guard of the Celts.” 1000
B. C. for the appearance of the Celts on the Rhine is a very
moderate estimate of the date at which these Nordics appear
in western Europe, as that would be nearly four centuries
after the appearance of the Achæans in Greece and
fully two centuries after the appearance of Nordics who spoke
Aryan in Italy. The Hallstatt culture (see p. 129) with which
the invasion of these Nordics is generally associated had
been in full development for four or five centuries before the
date here given for the crossing of the Rhine. 700 B. C.,
given by many authorities, seems to the author too late by
several centuries.</p>

<p class='c007'>173&#160;: 18 <em>seq.</em> G. Dottin, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel Celtique</span></cite>, pp. 453 <em>seq.</em>,
says: “If the Celts originated in Gaul, it is likely that their
language would have left in our nomenclature more traces
than we find, and above all, that the Celtic denominations
would be applied as well to mountains and water courses as
to inhabited places.... According to D’Arbois de Jubainville,
these names were Ligurian. Thus the Celts would have
named only fortresses, and the names properly geographic
would be due to the populations which preceded them....
These constituted for the most part the plebs, reduced almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>to the state of slavery, which the Celtic aristocracy of Druids
and Equites dominated.... On the other hand, if one
derives the Celts from central Europe, one explains better
both the presence in central Europe of numerous place names,
proving the establishment of dwellings of the Celts, and their
invasions into southeastern Europe, more difficult to conceive
if they had had to traverse the German forests. The
migration of a people to a more fertile country is natural
enough; the departure of the Celts from a fertile country like
Gaul to a less fertile country like Germany would be very
unlikely.” And it must be remembered that Tacitus wondered
why anyone should want to live in Germany, with its
disagreeable climate, trackless forests and endless swamps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dottin adds the interesting bit of information, on p. 197,
that the Gauls, mixed with the Illyrians (Alpines) were the
farmers of old Gaul. The real Gauls were warriors and
hunters.</p>

about the eighth century B. C., according to many
authors, among them G. Dottin, pp. 241, 457–458. “Cæsar,
Livy, Justinius, summing up Pompeius Trogus, Appian and
Plutarch, without doubt following a common source, even
think that excess population is the cause of the Gallic migrations.
It is one of the reasons to which Cæsar attributes the
emigration of the Helvetii. Cisalpine Gaul nourished an
immense population.”</p>

<p class='c007'>174&#160;: 21. Cymry move westward. See Rice Holmes, 2,

Deniker, 2, pp. 320–322; Dottin, pp. 460 <em>seq.</em> Both Rhys and
Jones, in the <cite>Welsh People</cite>, and G. Dottin, suggest that this
movement was only part of one great migration which dispersed
the Nordics from a central home. Their appearance
in Greece as Galatians at about the same time may be ascribed
to this migration. See the notes to p. 158&#160;: 1 <em>seq.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Oman and many other authorities think the movement
occurred some time before 325 B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>174&#160;: 21 <em>seq.</em> Cymry and Belgæ. The Cymry or Belgæ
were “P Celtic” in speech. They first appeared in history
about 300 B. C., equipped with a culture of the second iron
period called La Tène. The classic authors were apparently
uncertain as to whether or not they were Germans (or Teutons),
but they appear to have been largely composed of this
element, and to have arrived previously from Scandinavia
and to have adopted the Celtic tongue. These Belgæ drove
out the earlier “Q Celts” or Goidels, and the pressure they
exerted caused many of the later migrations of the Goidels
or Gauls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The groups of tribes which in Cæsar’s time occupied the
part of France to the north and east of the Seine were known
as Belgæ, while the same people who had crossed to the north
of the channel were called Brythons. To avoid designating
these groups separately the author has called all these tribes
Cymry, although the term can properly be applied only to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>the “<em>P</em> Celts” of Wales, who adopted this designation for
themselves about the sixth century A. D., according to Rhys
and Jones, p. 26, where we read: “The singular is Cymro,
the plural Cymry. The word Cymro, is derived from the
earlier Cumbrox or Combrox, which is parallel to the Gaulish
Allobrox (plural Allobroges) a name applied by the Gauls to
certain Ligurians whose country they conquered.... As
the word is to be traced to Cumbra-land (Cumberland), its
use must have extended to the Brythons” (see Rice Holmes,
2, p. 15, where he says the Brythons spread the La Tène
culture). “But as the name Cymry seems to have been unknown,
not only in Brittany, but also in Cornwall, it may be
conjectured that it cannot have acquired anything like national
significance for any length of time before the battle
of Deorham in the year 577, when the West Saxons permanently
severed the Celts west of the Severn from their kinsmen
(of Gloucester, Somerset, etc., as now known).</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thus it is probable that the national significance of the
term Cymro may date from the sixth century and is to be
regarded as the exponent of the amalgamation of the Goidelic
and Brythonic populations under high pressure from without
by the Saxons and Angles.” Therefore it is a purely Welsh
term, properly speaking. Broca, in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires d’anthropologie</span></cite>,
I, 871, p. 395, is responsible for the word as applied
to the invaders of Gaul who spoke Celtic. He called them
Kimris. See also his remarks in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la société
d’Anthropologie</span></cite>, XI, 1861, pp. 308–309, and the article by L.

2, p. 337; Fleure and James, pp. 118 <em>seq.</em> Taylor, 1, p. 109,
says that there is a superficial resemblance between the Teutons
and Celts, but a radical difference in skulls, the Teutonic
being more dolichocephalic. Both are tall, large-limbed
and fair. The Teuton is distinguished by a pink
and white skin, the Celt is more florid and inclined to freckle.
The Teuton eye is blue, that of the Celt gray, green, or grayish
blue.</p>

<p class='c007'>175&#160;: 21 <em>seq.</em> Rice Holmes, 2, p. 326 <em>seq.</em>, gives a summary
of the descriptions of various classic authors. Salomon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Reinach, 2, pp. 80 <em>seq.</em>, discusses Pausanias’ detailed recital

<p class='c007'>176&#160;: 15–177&#160;: 27. The series of notes which were collected
by the author on the wanderings of these Germanic
tribes proved so lengthy, and the relationships of the peoples
under discussion so intricate, that they grew beyond all
reasonable proportions as notes, and carried the subject far
afield. Hence it has seemed best to omit them in this connection
and to embody them in another work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps it will therefore be sufficient to say here that the
results of the research have made it clear that all of these
tribes were related by blood and by language, and came
originally from Scandinavia and the neighborhood of the
Baltic Sea. For some unknown reason, such as pressure of
population, they began, one after another, a southward
movement in the centuries immediately before the Christian
Era, which brought them within the knowledge of the Mediterranean
world. Their wanderings were very extensive
and covered Europe from southern Russia and the Crimea
to Spain, and even to Africa. Many of these tribes broke
up into smaller groups under distinct names, or united with
others to form large confederacies. Not only did some of
them clash with each other almost to the point of extermination
in their efforts to obtain lands, but in attempting to
avoid the Huns came into contact with the Romans, and
broke through the frontier of the Empire at various points.
From the Romans they gained many of the ideas which were
later incorporated by them in the various European nations
which they founded. The result of their conquests was to
establish a Nordic nobility and upper class in practically
every country of Europe,—a condition which has remained
to the present day.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>of the upper Rhine. Their name, to the neighboring Teutons,
came to designate a foreigner. The Volcæ were separated
into two branches, the Arecomici, established between
the Rhone and the Garonne, and the Tectosages, in the region
of the upper Garonne. The term Volcæ has become among
the Germans <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Walah</span></i>, then <em>Walch</em>, from which is derived
<em>Welsch</em>, which designates the people of Romance language,
such as the Italians and French. Among the Anglo-Saxons

designates the Gauls, and nowadays their former compatriots
who migrated to England and settled in Wales.</p>

of France (Francis I) poured money into Germany, and was
supported in his candidature by the pope; the king of England
(Henry VIII) sent Pace to counteract French designs

Germany would not tolerate a French ruler; and on June 28,

<p class='c007'>184&#160;: 8. Depopulation. (Thirty Years’ War.) <cite>Cambridge
Modern History</cite>, vol. IV, p. 418, says that Germany
was particularly afflicted. The data are unreliable, but the
population of the empire was probably reduced by two-thirds,
or from 16,000,000 to less than 6,000,000. Bavaria,
Franconia and Swabia suffered most. W. Menzel says:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>“Germany is reckoned by some to have lost one-half, by
others, two-thirds, of her entire population during the Thirty
Years’ War. In Saxony 900,000 men had fallen within ten
years; in Bohemia the number of inhabitants at the demise
of Frederick II, before the last deplorable inroads made by
Barier and Torstenson, had sunk to one-fourth. Augsburg,
instead of 80,000 had 18,000 inhabitants. Every province,
every town throughout the Empire had suffered at an equal
ratio, with the exception of Tyrol.... The working class
had almost totally disappeared. In Franconia the misery
and depopulation had reached such an extent that the Franconian
estates, with the assent of the ecclesiastical princes,
abolished in 1650 the celibacy of the Catholic clergy and permitted
each man to have two wives.... The nobility were
compelled by necessity to enter the services of the princes,
the citizens were impoverished and powerless, the peasantry
had been utterly demoralized by military rule and reduced
to servitude.” It has been said that the city of Berlin contained
but 300 citizens; the Palatinate of the Rhine but 200
farmers. In character, intelligence and in morality, the
German people were set back two hundred years. There
are, in addition to the authorities quoted here, numerous
others who make the same observations, in fact, this depopulation
is one of the outstanding results of the Thirty
Years’ War.</p>

<p class='c007'>189&#160;: 24. Varangians. Most of the early historians of
Russia and Germany and the monk Nestor, who was the
earliest annalist of the Russians, agree in deriving the Varangians
or Varegnes from Scandinavia. They probably were
more of the same people whom we find as Varini on the continental
shores of the North Sea. The names of the first
founders of the Russian monarchy are Scandinavian or
Northman. Their language, according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
differed essentially from the Sclavonian. The
author of the annals of St. Bertin, who first names the Russians
(Rhos) in the year 939 of his annals, assigns them Sweden
for their country. Luitprand calls them the same as the
Normans. The Finns, Laplanders and Esthonians speak of
the Swedes to the present day as Roots, Rootsi, Ruorzi,
Rootslane or Rudersman, meaning rowers. See Schlözer, in
his <cite>Nestor</cite>, p. 60; and <cite>Malte Brun</cite>, p. 378, as well as <cite>Kluchevsky</cite>,
vol. I, pp. 56–76 and 92. The Varangians, according to
Gibbon, formed the body-guard of the Greek Emperor at
Byzantium. These were the Russian Varangians, who made
their way to that city by the eastern routes. Canon Isaac
Taylor, in <cite>Words and Places</cite>, p. 110, remarks that “for centuries
the Varangian Guard upheld the tottering throne of
the Byzantine emperors.” This Varangian Guard was very
largely reinforced by Saxons fleeing from the Norman Conquest
of England. The name Varangi is undoubtedly identical
with <em>Frank</em>, and is the term used in the Levant to designate
Christians of the western rite, from the days of the
Crusades down to the present time. <em>Cf.</em> Ferangistan—<em>land
of the Franks</em>, or, as it is now interpreted, “Europe,” especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>western Europe. E. B. Soane, To <cite>Mesopotamia and Kurdistan

Feist, 5, p. 365. Col. W. R. Livermore, in correspondence,
says that practically all students on the Celtiberian
question agree upon the point where the Celts entered Spain,
namely, that designated by de Jubainville. They passed
along the Atlantic coast, across the Pyrenees, where the railroad
from Paris to Madrid now crosses, about 500 B. C.,
between the time of Avienus, ± 525 and Herodotus, ± 443.
In the time of Avienus the Ligurians had both ends of the
Pyrenees from Ampurias to Bayonne, and controlled the
sources of the Batis. In the time of Herodotus, the Gauls
had the country up to the Curretes. See also Müllenhoff,
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Altertumskunde</span></cite>, II, p. 238, and Deniker, 2, p. 321.
D’Arbois de Jubainville, <em>op. cit.</em>, especially pp. 363–364, says:
“The name Celtiberian was adopted at the time of Hannibal,
who entered Spain, married a Celt, and thus won the assistance
of the Celts in his march on Rome.... The name
Celtiberian is the generic term for designating the Celts established
in the center of Spain, but the word is sometimes
taken in a less extended sense to designate only one part of
this important group.”</p>

<p class='c007'>192&#160;: 18. Ridgeway, <em>op. cit.</em>, p. 375. Here he says: “The
Visigoths became the master race, and from them the Spanish
Grandees, among whom fair hair is a common feature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>derive their <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">sangre azul</span></i>. After a glorious struggle against
the Saracens, which served to keep alive their martial ardor
and thus brace up the ancient vigor of the race, from the
16th century onward the Visigothic wave seems to have exhausted
its initial energy, and the aboriginal stratum has
more and more come to the surface and has thus left Spain
sapless and supine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>102&#160;: 22. Taylor, 2, pp. 308–309, says: “From the name of
the same nation,—the Goths of Spain,—are derived curiously
enough, two names, one implying extreme honor, the other
extreme contempt. The Spanish noble, who boasts that the
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">sangre azul</span></i> of the Goths runs in his veins with no admixture,
calls himself an <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hidalgo</span></i>, that is, a son of the Goth, as his
proudest title.” A footnote to this reads: “The old etymology
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hijo d’algo</span></i>, son of someone, has been universally given
up in favor of <em>hi’ d’al Go</em>, son of the Goth. (More correctly
<em>hi’ del Go’</em>.) See a paper ‘On Oc and Oyl’ translated by
Bishop Thirlwall, for the <cite>Philological Museum</cite>, vol. II, p.
337.” Taylor goes on to say, however, that the version
<em>hi’ d’ algo</em>, son of someone, is still given as the origin of this
word in R. Barcia’s <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Primer Diccionaria Géneral Étimologico
de la Lengua Español</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning some other derivations Taylor continues: “Of
Gothic blood scarcely less pure than that of the Spanish
Hidalgos, are the Cagots of Southern France, a race of outcast
pariahs, who in every village live apart, executing every
vile or disgraceful kind of toil, and with whom the poorest
peasant refuses to associate. These Cagots are the descendants
of those Spanish Goths, who, on the invasion of the
Moors, fled to Aquitaine, where they were protected by
Charles Martel. But the reproach of Arianism clung to
them, and religious bigotry branded them with the name
<em>câ gots</em> or ‘Gothic Dogs.’ a name which still clings to them,
and keeps them apart from their fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elsewhere we find the following: “The fierce and intolerant
Arianism of the Visigothic conquerors of Spain has given
us another word. The word Visigoth has become Bigot,
and thus on the imperishable tablets of language the Catholics
have handed down to perpetual infamy the name and nation
of their persecutors.”</p>

his <cite>Life of Charlemagne</cite>, p. 7, states the following: “There
were two great divisions or tribes of the Franks, the Salians,
deriving their name probably from the river Isala, the Yssel,
who dwelt on the lower Rhine, and the Ripuarians, probably
from <em>Ripa</em>, a bank, who dwelt about the banks of the middle
Rhine. The latter were by far the most numerous, and
spread over a greater extent of country; but to the Salians
belongs the glory of founding the great Frankish kingdom
under the royal line of the Merwings” (Merovingians).</p>

<cite>Outspoken Essays</cite>, pp. 41–42: “The notion that frequent war
is a healthy tonic for a nation is scarcely tenable. Its dysgenic
effect, by eliminating the strongest and healthiest of
the population while leaving the weaklings at home to be
the fathers of the next generation, is no new discovery. It
has been supported by a succession of men, such as Tenon,
Dufau, Foissac, DeLapouge and Richet in France; Tiedemann
and Seeck in Germany; Guerrini in Italy; Kellogg and
Starr Jordan in America. The case is indeed overwhelming.
The lives destroyed in war are nearly all males, thus disturbing
the sex equilibrium of the population. They are in
the prime of life, at the age of greatest fecundity; and they
are picked from a list out of which from 20 to 30 per cent
have been rejected for physical unfitness. It seems to be
proved that the children born in France during the Napoleonic
wars were poor and undersized, 30 millimeters below the
normal height.”</p>

<p class='c007'>198&#160;: 22. Conscript Armies. Two interesting letters bearing
on the racial differences composing conscript and volunteer
armies in the recent World War may here be quoted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first, from Mr. T. Rice Holmes, relates to the English
army of Kitchener in 1915. “Perhaps it may interest you
to know that in 1915 when recruits belonging to Kitchener’s
army were training near Rochampton, I noticed that almost
every man was fair,—not, of course, with the pronounced
fairness of the men of the north of Scotland, who are descended
from Scandinavians, but with such fairness as is to be seen
in England. These men, as you know, were volunteers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The second, from DeLapouge, concerns our American
army in France. “I have been able to verify for myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>your observations on the American army. The first to arrive
were all volunteers, all dolicho-blonds; but the draft
afterwards brought in inferior elements. At St. Nazaire, at
Tours, and at Poictiers, I have been able to examine American
soldiers by the tens of thousands and I have been able to
formulate for myself a very definite conception of the types.”</p>

<p class='c007'>203&#160;: 5 <em>seq.</em> The intellectual inferiority of the Irish. If
there is any indication of the intellectual rating of various
foreign countries to be derived from the draft examinations
of our foreign-born, grouped according to place of nativity,
a paper by Major Bingham of Washington, in regard to “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>Relation of Intelligence Ratings to Nativity” may be quoted.
The total number of foreign-born examined, which formed
the basis of this report, was 12,407, while the total number of
native-born whites was 93,973. Only countries were considered
which were represented by more than 100 men in the
examinations. The tests were divided into those for literates
and those for illiterates, so that even men not speaking English
could be graded. In these examinations the Irish made
a surprisingly poor showing, falling far below the English
and Scotch, who stood very high, as well as below the Germans,
Austrians, French Canadians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians,
Swedes and Norwegians, being about on a par with
the Russians, Poles and Italians. Therefore, if these tests
are any criterion of intellectual ability, the Irish are noticeably
inferior.</p>

<p class='c007'>204&#160;: 5. There is an amusing discussion in Rice Holmes,
1, on the Pictish question. See pp. 409–424. Rice Holmes
contends that the Picts were not pure remnants of the Pre-Celtic
inhabitants, but a mixture of these with Celts. The
term Picts has been very widely accepted as a designation for
those Pre-Celtic inhabitants, who were certainly there. No
other name has been given for them and it is in this sense
that it is used here, and that Rice Holmes himself is obliged
to use it on p. 456. It will be useful to the reader to peruse
pp. 13–16 of Rhys and Jones, <cite>The Welsh People</cite>. Appendix
B, of that volume (pp. 617 <em>seq.</em>), written by Sir J. Morris
Jones, entitled “Pre-Aryan Syntax in Insular Celtic,” shows
the Anaryan survivals in Welsh and Irish to be remarkably
similar to ancient Egyptian, which, with the Berber of intermediate
situation, belongs to the great Hamitic family of
languages and was the tongue of the primitive Mediterraneans.
For Beddoe’s opinion see 4, p. 36. On p. 247 he
says, speaking of the Highland people: “Every here and there
a decidedly Iberian physiognomy appears, which makes one
think Professor Rhys right in supposing that the Picts were
in part, at least, of that stock.” See Hector McLean, 1,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>p. 170, where he suggests that the Picts were originally the
Pictones from the south bank of the Loire in Gaul.</p>

<p class='c007'>The name Pixie, met with so frequently in Irish legends,
and relating to little people similar to dwarfs, may have some
connection with these shy little Mediterraneans whom the
Nordics found on their arrival and who were forced back by
them into inaccessible districts.</p>

<p class='c007'>204&#160;: 19. See the article on “Pre-Aryan Syntax in Insular
Celtic,” just mentioned, and Beddoe, 4, p. 46, quoting
Elton, p. 167. For other Non-Aryan remnants, especially in
names, see Hector McLean, 1, <em>passim</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>206&#160;: 3. Fleure and James, pp. 38, 75, 119, 152. These
gentlemen say, on p. 38, that they believe that certain types,
without any intervening social or linguistic barrier for centuries,
have apparently persisted side by side in very marked
fashion in certain parts of Wales.</p>

<p class='c007'>A letter from Mr. Baring Gould confirms this: “In Wales
there are two types, the dark Siluric and the light Norman.
Here in the west of England we have the same two types.
In this neighborhood one village is fair, the next dark and
sallow. It is the same in Cornwall; in certain villages the
type is dark and sallow, in others fair. There is no comparison
between the capabilities moral and physical between
the two types. The dark is tricky, unreliable and goes
under, and the fair type predominates in trade, in business,
in farming and in every department.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Beddoe, Fleure and James, and also Hector McLean remark
on the various moral and mental capabilities of the
different physical types.</p>

<p class='c007'>208&#160;: 8. Beddoe, 4, p. 95. The breadth of skull “of the
Norman aristocracy may probably have been smaller, but
the ecclesiastics of Norman or French nationality, who
abounded in England for centuries after the conquest and
who, in many cases, rose from the subjugated Celtic [Alpine]
layer of population, have left us a good many broad and round
skulls. Thus the crania of three bishops of Durham&#160;...
yield an index of 85.6, while those of eight Anglican canons
dating from before the conquest yield one of 74.9. So far,
however, as the actual conquest and armed occupation of
England was concerned, the aristocracy and military caste,
who were largely of Scandinavian type, came over in much
larger proportion than the more Belgic or Celtic lower ranks,
insomuch that it has been said that more of the Norman
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</span></i> came over to England than were left behind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the Middle Ages the church was a very democratic
institution, and it was only through its offices that the lower
ranks succeeded in working their way up. This was partly
because the older peoples possessed the Roman learning, and
because the northern invaders were more addicted to martial
than to priestly pursuits. The conquered people had no
chance to rise in political, aristocratic or military circles, and
contented themselves with the church. At the present time,
in many Catholic countries, notably Ireland, the priests are
derived from the lowest stratum of the population, as may
be clearly recognized in their portraits.</p>

book. D’Arbois de Jubainville, 4, t. I, pp. ix and 214, gives
the date when the Indo-Europeans were united as 2500 B. C.
Feist, 5, believes the Nordics were still in their homeland
between 2500 and 2000 B. C. This was the transition period
from Stone to Bronze in north-middle and eastern Europe.
Breasted, <cite>Ancient Times</cite>, says: “It has recently been scientifically
demonstrated on the basis, chiefly, of the Amarna
tablets and other cuneiform evidence, that the Aryans had
by 2000 or 1800 B. C. begun to leave a home on the east or
southeast of the Caspian, where they divided into two
branches, one going southeast into India, the other southwest
into Babylon.” “The first occurrence of Indo-European
names is in the Tell-el-Amarna (Egyptian) correspondence,”
says Myres, <cite>Dawn of History</cite>, p. 153, “which gives so vivid
a picture of Syrian affairs in the years immediately after
1400. They represent chieftains scattered up and down
Syria and Palestine, and they include the name of Tushratta,
king of the large district of Mitanni beyond Euphrates....
But this is a minor matter; nothing is commoner in the history
of migratory peoples than to find a very small leaven of
energetic intruders ruling and organizing large native populations
without either learning their subjects’ language or
improving their own until considerably later, if at all. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Norman princes, for example, bear Teutonic names, Robert,
William, Henry; but it is Norman French in which they
govern Normandy and correspond with the king of France.
All these Indo-European names (mentioned in the tablets),
belong to the Iranian group of languages, which is later found
widely spread over the whole plateau of Persia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>214&#160;: 1 <em>seq.</em> See pp. 158–159 of this book.</p>

<p class='c007'>214&#160;: 7 <em>seq.</em> Herodotus, IV, 17, 18, 33, 53, 65, 74, etc., for
notes on the Scythians. Wheat was cultivated in the southern
part of Scythia. Corn was an article of trade, and the
loom was used. See also Zaborowski, 1; Ripley; Feist, 5.</p>

<p class='c007'>214&#160;: 10. Scythians. According to Zaborowski, 1, the
Scythians were the earliest known Nordic nomads of Scythia,
or southern Russia, from whom no doubt came the Achæans,
Cimmerians, etc., and later the Persian conquerors, the leaders
of the Kassites and Mitanni, etc. The Sacæ were an
eastern branch of the Scythians (and likewise the Massagetæ),
who threw off branches into India. Possibly the Wu-Suns
and the Epthalites, or White Huns, were eastern offshoots.
Owing to the fact that Scythia has been swept time
and again by various hordes moving east and west, and has
served no doubt as a meeting-ground for Alpines, Nordics
and Mongols, these may all, at some period or another, have
been called Scythians because they inhabited this little-known
territory. But the indications are strongly in favor
of the original Scythians being Nordics. It is in this sense
that the name is here applied. Minns, <cite>Scythians and Greeks</cite>,
and D’Arbois de Jubainville, 4, t. I, are two other authorities
who have discussed the Scythians at length.</p>

<p class='c007'>215&#160;: 25. Dante Alighieri. It is interesting to know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>the name Aligheri is Gothic, a corruption of Aldiger. It belongs
to such German names as those which include the word
“<em>ger</em>,” spear, as in Gerhard, Gertrude, etc. This name came
into the family through Dante’s grandmother on the father’s
side, a Goth from Ferrara, whose name was Aldigero. With
regard to the origin of his grandfather and mother, the attempt
to connect him with Roman families is known to be
a pure fiction on the part of the Italian biographers, who
thought it more glorious to be a Roman than anything else;
but his descent from pure Germanic parentage is practically
proved, since the grandfather was a warrior, knighted by the
emperor Conrad, and Dante himself declares that he belonged
to the petty nobility. Even to the beginning of the
fifteenth century many Italians are described in old documents
as Alemanni, Langobardi, etc., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex alamanorum genere</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legibus vivens Langobardorum</span></i>, etc. Though the majority of
them had adopted Roman law, whereby the documentary
evidence of their descent usually disappeared, they were
thoroughly Germanic in blood, especially those to whom
Rome owes much. See Franz Xaver Kraus, Dante, pp.
21–25, and Savigny, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte des römischen Rechte im Mittelalter</span></cite>,

<p class='c007'>Blond Moors. Procopius says, IV, 13, describing the fighting
with the Moors in Mauretania beyond Mt. Aurasium,
which is thirteen days’ journey west of Carthage: “I have
heard Ortaias say that beyond these nations of Moors, beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Aurasium, which he ruled” [apparently south] “there
was no habitation of men, but desert land to a great distance,
and that beyond this desert there are men, not black-skinned
like the Moors, but very white in body and fair-haired.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. J. B. Thornhill relates that about fifteen years ago he
was in Morocco (presumably near Tangier) and while there
he saw several purely blond Berbers from the Riff mountains.
A young girl, especially, was an almost pure Swedish blond.
The coloring, however, was pale and whitish rather than
pink; the eyes were blue and the hair wavy and very blond.</p>

<p class='c007'>223&#160;: 21. For the Philistines, Anakim and Achæans see
Ridgeway, 1, pp. 618 <em>seq.</em> Sir William Ridgeway places the
appearance of the Philistines as nearly synchronous with
that of the Achæans, and states that their weapons and armor
were similar to those of the Achæans, but different from those
of the other nations of the early world. <em>Cf.</em> also Hall, <cite>Ancient
History of the Near East</cite>, p. 72, especially footnote 1, where he
says: “The Philistines were specially receptive of Hellenic
culture and eager to claim relationship with the Greeks, and
disassociate themselves from the Semites. Their coin types
shew this, see p. 399, n.” He regards them as Cretans.</p>

<p class='c007'>223&#160;: 22–23. Sons of Anak. Numbers, XIII, 33: “And

“Whither shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged
our heart, saying, ‘The people is greater and taller than we;
the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover
we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fairness of David. I Samuel, XVI, 11, 12: “And Samuel
said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said,
There remaineth the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the
sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him;
for we shall not sit down till he come hither. And he sent,
and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a
beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to....” Chap.
XVII, 41,42: “And the Philistine came on and drew near unto
David, and when the Philistine looked about, and saw David,
he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>a fair countenance.” In the Hebrew, the phrase <cite>Of a Beautiful
Countenance</cite> means fair of eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The presence of Nordics in Syria among the Amorites is
indicated by the tall stature, long-headedness and fair skin
with which they are depicted on the Egyptian monuments.

upon another blond people the Wu-Suns, whose importance
was such that the Chinese, who have made them known to
us, sought their alliance against the Huns. The Chinese
knew then, in Turkestan, only the Wu-Suns, the Sse, or
Sacæ, and the Ta-hia (our Tadjiks).”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Yuë-Tchi, repulsed by the Wu-Suns in 130 B. C.,
hurled themselves upon Bactria” (see the notes to p. 119&#160;: 13).
“The Sacæ were then masters of it and their dispossession
resulted in pressing them in part into India where they
founded a kingdom and also in part into the Pro-Pamirian
valleys, especially that of the Oxus. The Yuë-Tchi ruled
over central Asia until 425 A. D. They were dispossessed
in their turn by the Hoas, or Ephtalite Huns” (White Huns).</p>

<p class='c007'>225&#160;: 11. Phrygians. Bury, <cite>History of Greece</cite>, pp. 46–48,
says: “But about this very time (1287 B. C.) the Hittite
power was declining and northwestern Asia Minor as far as
the valley of the Sangarius, was wrested from their rule by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>swarms of new invaders from Europe. These were the
Phrygians to whose race the Dardanians belonged and who
were so closely akin to the Thracians that we may speak of
the Phrygo-Thracian division of the Indo-European family.”
On p. 44 we read: “The dynasty from which the Homeric
kings, Agamemnon and Menelaus sprang, was founded according
to Greek tradition, early in the 13th century (B. C.)
by Pelops, a Phrygian. Agamemnon and Menelaus represent
the Achæan stock.... The meaning of this Phrygian relationship
is not clear.” But if we follow the extent of the
Achæan invasions and the relation of the art and language
of archaic Phrygia to archaic Greece, the difficulty seems
solved. See Hall, <cite>Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, p. 475.
The <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite> (Phrygia) says: “According to
unvarying Greek tradition the Phrygians were most closely
akin to certain tribes of Macedonia and Thrace; and their
near relationship to the Hellenic stock is proved by all that
is known of their language and art, and is accepted by
almost every modern authority.... The inference has
been generally drawn that the Phrygians belonged to a stock
widespread in the countries which lie around the Ægean
Sea. There is, however, no conclusive evidence whether this
stock came from the east, over Armenia, or was European in
origin and crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor; but modern
opinion inclines decidedly to the latter view”; and we
may add that the recently demonstrated linguistic affiliations
strengthen this assumption. See also Ridgeway, 1,

<p class='c007'>225&#160;: 19. Von Luschan, p. 243, says: “All western Asia
was originally inhabited by a homogeneous, melanochroic
race, with extreme hypsi-brachycephaly and with a ‘Hittite’
nose. About 4000 B. C. began a Semitic invasion from the
southeast, probably from Arabia, by people looking like
modern Bedawy. 2000 years later commenced a second invasion,
this time from the northwest by xanthochrous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>long-headed tribes like the modern Kurds, and perhaps connected
with the historic Harri, Amorites, Tamahu and Galatians.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The modern ‘Turks,’ Greeks and Jews are all three
equally composed of these three elements, the Hititte, the
Semitic, and the xanthochrous Nordic. Not so the Armenians
and Persians. They, and still more, the Druses, Maronites,
and the smaller sectarian groups of Syria and Asia Minor,
represent the old Hittite element, and are little, or not at
all, influenced by the somatic characters of alien invaders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Luschan means by Persians, the round-headed Medic
element, which has always been in the majority and which
has, at the present day, practically submerged the once
powerful, dominant Nordic class, which he says is still seen
not rarely in some old noble families.</p>

<p class='c007'>225&#160;: 20. Until rather recently nothing much was known
about the wild Kurdish tribes living in southeast Anatolia,
and what reports there were, were frequently conflicting.
There are two kinds of Kurds, dark and light. More data
has gradually accumulated, however, and it seems that the
true Kurds are tall, blond people, who resemble very much
the inhabitants of northern Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ratzel, <cite>History of Mankind</cite>, says, quoting Polak: “The
Kurds are, in color of skin, hair and eyes, so little different to
the northern, especially the Teutonic breed, that they might
easily be taken for Germans. There is nothing to contradict
this racial affinity in the reputation for honor and courage,
which in spite of their rapacious tendencies, the Kurds
enjoy wherever it has been found possible to compel them to
labor or to the trade of arms. In Persia the Shah entrusts
the security of his person to Kurdish officers rather than to
any others. Their loyalty to their hereditary Wali, which
neither Turks nor Persians have been able to shake, is also
noted with praise. The Kurd prefers to wander with his
herds and in the winter lives in caves like Xenophon’s Carduchi....
The Kurds are a highly mixed race of a type
chiefly Iranian, which has been compared with the Afghan
but is not homogeneous. The eastern Kurds must have received
a larger infusion of Turkish blood than the western.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>‘Husbandmen by necessity, fighters by inclination.’ says
Moltke, ‘the Arab is more of a thief, the Kurd more of a
warrior.’ They are a vigorous, violent race, running wild in
tribal feuds and vendettas.... Their women hold a freer
position than those of the Turks and Persians.” The quotation
is from vol. III, p. 537.</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Luschan, <em>op. cit.</em>, p. 229, describes them thus: “[They]
have long heads and generally blue eyes and fair hair. They
are probably descended from the Kardouchoi and Gordyæans
of old historians. They live southeast of the Armenian mountains.
The western Kurds are dolichocephalic and more
than half of them are fair. The eastern Kurds are little
known but are apparently darker and more round-headed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soane, in <cite>To Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise</cite>, gives
a very full description of them, confirming the above. There
are so many tribes differing from one another, that only the
briefest summary may be given. It is found on pp. 398 <em>seq.</em>
“Judged as specimens of the human form, there is probably
no higher standard extant that that of the Kurds. The
northerner is a tall, thin man (obesity is absolutely unknown
among the Kurds). The nose is long, thin and often a little
hooked, the mouth small, the face oval and long. The men
usually grow a long moustache, and invariably shave the
beard. The eyes are piercing and fierce. Among them are
many of yellow hair and bright blue eyes; and the Kurdish
infant of this type, were he placed among a crowd of English
children, would be indistinguishable from them, for he has
a white skin. In the south the face is a little broader sometimes,
and the frame heavier. Of forty men of the southern
tribes taken at random, there were nine under six feet,
though among some tribes the average height is five feet
nine. The stride is long and slow, and the endurance of
hardship great. They hold themselves as only mountain
men can do, proudly and erect.... Many and many a
man have I seen among them who might have stood for the
picture of a Norseman. Yellow, flowing hair, a long drooping
moustache, blue eyes, and a fair skin—one of the most
convincing proofs, if physiognomy be a criterion (were their
language not a further proof), that the Anglo-Saxon and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Kurd are one and the same stock.” For a list of Kurdish
tribes and their numbers and affiliations see Mark Sykes,
vol. XXXVIII of the <cite>Jour. of the Roy. Anth. Soc. of Great
Britain and Ireland</cite>, and Von Luschan, <em>op. cit.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>From all this evidence by men who have travelled among
them it would appear that the Kurds are descendants of
some ancient Nordic invaders who have found refuge in the
mountain regions north of Mesopotamia. <em>Cf.</em> the note to
p. 239&#160;: 16.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CHAPTER XI. RACIAL APTITUDES</h4>

<p class='c015'>226&#160;: 7. Conklin, in <cite>Heredity and Environment</cite>, p. 207,
says: “Psychological characters appear to be inherited in
the same way that anatomical and physiological traits are;
indeed, all that has been said regarding the correlation of
morphological and physiological characters applies also to
psychological ones. No one doubts that particular instincts,
aptitudes and capacities are inherited among both animals
and men, nor that different races and species differ hereditarily
in psychological characteristics. The general tendency
of recent work on heredity is unmistakable, whether
it concerns man or lower animals. The entire organism,
consisting of structures and functions, body and mind, develops
out of the germ, and the organization of the germ determines
all the possibilities of development of the mind no
less than of the body, though the actual realization of any
possibility is dependent also upon environmental stimuli.”</p>

<p class='c007'>229&#160;: 6. It may be interesting in this connection to quote
Fleure and James, pp. 118–119, who, after giving illustrations
of Mediterranean types, say of them: “Types 1(a) to 1(c)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>contribute considerable numbers to the ministries of the various
churches, possibly in part from inherent and racial leanings,
but partly also because these are the people of the
Moorlands. The idealism of such people usually expresses
itself in music, poetry, literature and religion, rather than in
architecture, painting and plastic arts generally. They rarely
have a sufficiency of material resources for the latter activities.
These types also contribute a number of men to the
medical profession, for somewhat similar reasons, no doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The successful commercial men, who have given the Welsh
their extraordinarily prominent place in British trade (shipping
firms, for example), usually belong to types 2 or 4”
[Nordic and Nordic-Alpine, Beaker Maker], “rather than to
1, as also do the great majority of Welsh members of Parliament,
though there are exceptions of the first importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Nordic type is marked by ingenuity and enterprise
in striking out new lines. Type 2(c)” [Beaker Maker] “in
Wales is remarkable for governmental ability of the administrative
kind as well as for independence of thought and
critical power.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The following remarks are taken from Beddoe, 4, p. 142:
“In opposition to the current opinion it would seem that the
Welsh rise most in commerce, the Scotch coming after them
and the Irish nowhere. The people of Welsh descent and
name hold their own fairly in science; the Scotch do more,
the Irish less. But when one looks to the attainment of
military or political distinction, the case is altered. Here
the Scotchmen, and especially the Highlanders bear away
the palm; the Irish retrieve their position and the Welsh are
little heard of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>See also p. 10 of Beddoe’s <cite>Races of Britain</cite>, and Hector
McLean in vol. IV, pp. 218 <em>seq.</em> of the <cite>Anthropological Review</cite>
and elsewhere. The following quotation from Hall’s <cite>Ancient
History of the Near East</cite> is interesting:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Knowing what we do of the psychological peculiarities
of the different races of mankind, it is perhaps not an illegitimate
speculation to wonder whence the Greeks inherited this
sense of proportion in their whole mental outlook. The
feeling of Hellenes for art in general was surely inherited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>from their forebears on the Ægean, not the Indo-European
side.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The feeling for naturalistic art, for truth of representation,
may have come from the Ægeans, but the equally
characteristic love of the crude and bizarre was not inherited:
the sense of proportion inhibited it. In fact, we may ascribe
this sense to the Aryan element in the Hellenic brain, to
which must also be attributed the Greek political sense, the
idea of the rights of the folk and of the individual in it.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
The Mediterranean possessed the artistic sense without the
sense of proportion: the Aryan had little artistic sense but
had the sense of proportion and justice, and with it the political
sense. The result of the fusion of the two races we see
in the true canon of taste and beauty in all things that had
become the ideal of the Greeks,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and was through them to
become the ideal of mankind.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. “We have only to look around and seek, vainly, for any self-developed
artistic feeling among the pure Indo-Europeans. The
Kassites had none and blighted that of Babylonia for centuries: the
Persians had none and merely adopted that of Assyria: the Goths
and Vandals had none: the Celts and Teutons have throughout the
centuries derived theirs from the Mediterranean region.”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The predominance of the Aryan element in Greek political ideas
is obvious. It is not probable that the old Ægean had any more
definite political ideas than had his relative the Egyptian.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. “In matters of political and ordinary justice between man and
man they fell short of their ideal often enough, but they had the
reasonable ideal: the barbarians had none. The Egyptians were
an imaginative race, but their imagination was untrammelled by
the sense of proportion: their only thinker with reasonable and
logical ideas, Akhenaten, soon became as mad a fanatic as any unreasonable
Nitrian monk or Arab Mahdi. Ordinarily speaking,
Egyptian and Semitic ideals were purely religious, and so, to the
Greek mind, beyond the domain of reason. The Babylonians, Assyrians,
and Phœnicians cannot be said ever to have possessed any
ideals of any kind.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>229&#160;: 22. Fleure and James, p. 146, say: “In the folk
tales, it is true, the people are called fairies but colouring is
mentioned only in one case—that is of a trader from the sea
who is said to be fair; <em>i. e.</em>, fair hair is treated as something
worthy of special mention. The fairy children (changelings)
are always described in such a way as to suggest that they
were dark, and that they were the children of the Upland-folk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>of our hypothesis—<em>i. e.</em>, mostly of Mediterranean race.
In the romances the princes and princesses are said to be
fair, as though that were exceptional. Our friend, Mr. J.
H. Shaxby, draws our attention to the probability that the
word fair in ‘fair’ or ‘fair-folk’ does not refer to physical
traits, but is an adulatory term such as men so generally
use in describing beings about whom their superstitions
gather.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Every now and then some reference to this question is
noted in the daily papers. Not long ago, in one of the large
New York dailies, there appeared a short paragraph concerning
the letter of Lentulus. All mention of the extremely
doubtful authenticity of this letter was omitted. The
<cite>Catholic Cyclopædia</cite>, vol. IX, discusses the matter as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Publius Lentulus, A fictitious person said to have been
the governor of Judea before Pontius Pilate and to have
written the following letter to the Roman Senate: “Lentulus,
the Governor of the Jerusalemites, to the Roman Senate
and People, greetings. There has appeared in our times
and there still lives, a man of great power (virtue), called
Jesus Christ. The people call him prophet of truth; his
disciples son of God. He raises the dead, and heals infirmities.
He is a man of medium size (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">statura procerus, mediocris
et spectabilis</span></i>); he has a venerable aspect, and his beholders
can both fear and love him. His hair is of the color of the
ripe hazel nut, straight down to the ears, but below the ears
wavy and curled, with a bluish and bright reflection flowing
over his shoulders. It is parted in two on the top of the
head, after the pattern of the Nazarenes. His brow is smooth
and very cheerful, with a face without a wrinkle or spot,
embellished by a slightly ruddy complexion. His nose and
mouth are faultless. His beard is abundant, of the color of
his hair, not long, but divided at the chin. His aspect is
simple and mature, his eyes are changeable and bright. He
is terrible in his reprimands, sweet and amiable in his admonitions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>cheerful without loss of gravity. He was never
known to laugh, but often to weep. His stature is straight,
his hands and arms beautiful to behold. His conversation
is grave, infrequent and modest. He is the most beautiful
among the children of men.” The letter was first printed
in <cite>The Life of Christ</cite>, by Ludolph the Carthusian, at Cologne,
1474. According to the manuscript of Jena, a certain Giacomo
Colonna found the letter in an ancient Roman document
sent to Rome from Constantinople. It must be of
Greek origin and have been translated into Latin during the
thirteenth or fourteenth century, though it received its
present form at the hands of a humanist of the fifteenth or
sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'>The description agrees with the so-called Abgar picture of
Our Lord. It also agrees with the portrait of Jesus Christ
drawn by Nicephorus, St. John Damascene, and the Book
of Painters (of Mt. Athos). Munter, (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Sinnbilder und
Kunstvorstellungen der alten Christen</span></cite>, Altona, 1825, p. 9),
believes he can trace the letter down to the time of Diocletian,
but this is not generally admitted. The Letter of Lentulus
is certainly apocryphal; there never was a governor of
Jerusalem; no procurator of Judea is known to have been
called Lentulus; a Roman governor would not have addressed
the Senate, but the Emperor; a Roman writer would
not have employed the expressions, “prophet of truth,”
“sons of men,” “Jesus Christ.” The former two are Hebrew
idioms, the third is taken from the New Testament.
The letter, therefore, shows us a description of Our Lord such
as Christian piety conceived him.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is considerable literature touching on this letter,
for which see the <cite>Catholic Cyclopædia</cite>. Although we cannot
credit the letter as genuine, it is interesting, as the article
indicated, in showing the popular attitude to the traits in
question, and in attributing these Nordic characters to
Christ, as are the occasional efforts to bring the matter up
again in the journals of to-day.</p>

occupied central Italy but who migrated, under the pressure
of the Umbrians, toward the south. There some of them
survived under the name Iapyges or Messapians, in the heel
of the peninsula. “The name Iapyges seems identical with
that of the Iapodes, that Illyrian tribe which dwelt on the
other side of the Adriatic, largely contaminated with the
Celts (Nordics) who had flowed down over them. That the
Umbrians had a deadly hatred of a people of the same name,
who had survived in their coast area, is proved by the
Iguvine Tables, where the <em>Iapuzkum numen</em> is heartily cursed
along with the Etruscans and the men of Nar.”</p>

shows his wrong reasoning, rather convincingly it seems to
the author. The opinions of Jullian, as given in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire

in English, of all the authorities on ancient Liguria,
the Ligurians and their language is given in Rice Holmes,
<cite>Cæsar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, pp. 277–287. The language is
treated on pp. 281–284, and 318, and by Peet, <cite>The Stone and

3, pp. 152 <em>seq.</em> Feist, 5, p. 369, says that the Ligurians
were Mediterraneans. A number of others agree with him.
The evidence points rather to their having been an early
Alpine people, somewhat less brachycephalic than those who
came later, and this is the opinion held by Ratzel, vol. III, p.
561. The name Ligurian in this book designates a Pre-Nordic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>race of Alpine affinities, with a Pre-Aryan language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peculiar and discontinuous distribution of Alpine
peoples with names which are variations of the term Veneti,
a condition rather analogous to the scattered groups of Pelasgians
as noted by various authors of antiquity, may indicate
the last traces of a once widely distributed race. It is possible
that the Ligurians displaced these “Veneti” in southern
Europe, and later became confined to a part of Gaul and
northern Italy.</p>

of the Hittite Empire has been brought to light by the
research and investigations of Professor Sayce. See his <cite>Hittites</cite>.
There are a number of short general descriptions in
practically all of the histories of ancient peoples, and in those
of the Near East. See for instance, Bury, <cite>History of Greece</cite>,
pp. 45, 64; Hall, <cite>Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, pp. 200,

pp. 406 <em>seq.</em>; Von Luschan, pp. 242–243; and Zaborowski, 1,
pp. 121, 134, 138 and 160, deal more with the physical characters
of the Hittites.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to some of the most recent authorities, the Hittites
were an extraordinarily powerful nation and held Syria
from about 3700 B. C. to 700 B. C., when the Assyrians
overcame them. They had some contact with Babylon and
probably their development was influenced thereby. They
seem to have been the Kheta or Khatti of the Ancient Egyptians.
“About 1280 B. C.,” according to Von Luschan,
“when Khattusil made his peace with Rameses II, there existed
a large empire, not much smaller than Germany, reaching
from the Ægean Sea to Mesopotamia and from Kadesh
on the Orontes to the Black Sea. We do not know at present
if this Hittite Empire ever had a really homogeneous
population, but we have a good many Hittite reliefs and all
these, without one single exception, show us the high and
short heads, or the characteristic noses of our modern brachycephalic
groups, (Armenoids).”</p>

<p class='c007'>As to their language, J. D. Prince, correspondence, says
that it was not Aryan, in spite of all conjectures to the contrary.
“Friedrich Delitzsch analyzed some of the only syllabized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>material we have of this language, and I analyzed it
still further in the <cite>Journal of the American Oriental Society</cite>,
vol. XXII, ‘Hittite Material in the Cuneiform Inscriptions,’
reaching the conclusion as to the Non-Aryan character of
this idiom. The so-called ‘Hittite Inscriptions’ are in hieroglyphs
and give us no clue as to the pronunciation and hence
none to the character of the language.” Von Luschan, p.
242, says: “Orientalists are unanimous in assuming that the
Hittite language was not Semitic.” A very recent communication
from Fr. Cumont, in <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Académie des inscriptions
et belles lettres</span></cite> for April 20, 1917, says that the tongue is
proved to have been Aryan.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to their physical characters, all are agreed that the
Hittites had short, brachycephalic heads, and thick, prominent
noses. Myres, p. 44, remarks that the earliest portraits,
which he dates about 1285 B. C., have been thought by
some to be Mongoloid, but the evidence is still scanty and
inconclusive. Surely if the older likenesses were Mongoloid,
they bear no resemblance to the later types. On the monuments
bearded figures are frequent and the type is Armenoid.
See Hall, <cite>The Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, p. 334, for a
criticism of the Mongol theory.</p>

<p class='c007'>239&#160;: 10. Sumer. J. D. Prince, in his article on the Sumerians
in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, classes the Sumerian
language as agglutinative. The language of Susiana is also
known as Anzanite, Susian or Elamite. The Anzanite may
have been a dialect of Susian. Schiel’s work with de Morgan’s
mission shows that Elamite was agglutinative and
that inflections found in derived words are due to the influence
of another language. The locality of Anzan is not
known exactly, but is believed to have been in the plain
south or southeast of Susa. See also Zaborowski, 1, pp. 149–150,
and Hall, <cite>The Ancient History of the Near East</cite>. Hall
agrees with Prince that Sumerian is agglutinative (p. 171).
He also states that Elamite was agglutinative, but not otherwise
like Sumerian. See his chap. V for the relationships of
Sumerians and Elamites.</p>

Myres, <cite>Dawn of History</cite>, pp. 114–116, 140; and other histories
of the Near East.</p>

<p class='c007'>239&#160;: 13. Kassites. See Hall, pp. 198–200. Very little
is known about the Kassites. Hall declares that there is
very little doubt but that they were Indo-European; Prince,
from the same information, says this could not possibly be
the case. They are supposed to have been an Elamite tribe
who were living in the northwestern mountains of Elam,
immediately south of Holwan, when Sennacherib attacked
them in 702 B. C. They attacked Babylonia in the ninth
year of Samsu-iluma, the son of Khammurabi, overran it
and founded a dynasty there in 1780 B. C., which lasted 576
years. They became absorbed into the Babylonian population;
the kings adopted Semitic names and married into the
royal family of Assyria. Like the other languages of the
Non-Semitic tribes of Elam, according to Prince, that of the
Kassites was agglutinative. That the Kassites had been in
contact with the horse-using nomads of the northern steppes,
is indicated by the fact that they first introduced the horse
into Mesopotamian lands, whence its use for riding and
drawing chariots spread into Egypt in 1700 B. C. See
Breasted, <cite>Ancient Times</cite>, p. 138.</p>

<p class='c007'>239&#160;: 16. Mitanni. Very little is known of the Mitanni.
Von Luschan, p. 230, dates them around the fourteenth century
B. C. In 1380 they called themselves Harri, from Harri-ya,
an old form of the word Aryan. Myres, <cite>Dawn of History</cite>,
says: “The conquest of Syria in 1500 B. C. brought
Egypt face to face with a homogeneous state called Mitanni,
occupying the whole foothill country east of the Euphrates....
The Egyptian conquest came just in time to relieve
the kingdom of Mitanni from severe pressure exerted simultaneously
and probably in collusion, by its neighbors in the
foothills,—Assyria on the east, and the Hittites west of the
Euphrates. Egypt made friends with Mitanni and more
than one marriage was arranged between the royal houses.
Soon after the treaty between Egypt and Mitanni, Subiluliuma,
king of the Hittites of Cappadocia, whom Egyptian
scribes conveniently abbreviate as Saplel, was overlord apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>of a number of outpost baronies in north Syria.
Assured of their help, and watching his opportunity, he flung
his whole force, about 1400 upon Mitanni.... This closed
the career of Mitanni.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The racial affinities of Mitanni are doubtful. Prince, correspondence,
says the language of Mitanni was certainly not
Aryan. It has been thoroughly analyzed by Ferdinand
Bork, in his <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Mitanni Sprache</span></cite>, who compares it with the
Georgian or Imeretian branch of the Caucasic linguistic
groups. The Mitanni are not to be confused with the Ossetes,
who speak a highly archaic, real Aryan language. Mitanni,
in structure, is like the polysynthetic North American groups.
Feist, 1, p. 14, says the Mitanni were Nordics and inhabited
the western mountains of Iran, in Zagros. In 5, p. 406, he
places them on the north of the Euphrates during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries B. C. See also Hall, p. 200, the following
note and that to p. 213&#160;: 1–23 of this book. Hall
also considers them Nordics.</p>

<p class='c007'>239&#160;: 16 <em>seq.</em> Von Luschan, p. 230, asks: “Can it be mere
accident that a few miles north of the actual frontier of
modern Kurdish languages there is Boghaz-Köi, the old
metropolis of the Hittite Empire, where Hugo Winckler in
1908 found tablets with two political treaties of King Subiluliuma
with Mattiuaza, son of Tušrata, king of Mitanni, and
in both of these treaties Aryan divinities, Mithra, Varuna,
Indra and Nasatya are invoked, together with Hittite divinities,
as witnesses and protectors? And in the same inscriptions,
which date from about 1380 B. C., the king of Mitanni
and his people are called Harri, just as nine centuries later
in the Achæmenidian inscriptions Xerxes and Darius call
themselves Har-ri-ya, ‘Aryans of Aryan stock.’ So the
Kurds,” concludes Von Luschan, “are the descendants of
Aryan invaders and have maintained their type and their
language for more than 3300 years.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>
  <h4 class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII. ORIGIN OF THE ARYAN LANGUAGES</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>242&#160;: 5. The following notes on languages were taken
mostly from the <cite>History of Language</cite>, by Henry Sweet, and
were supplemented by the writings of W. D. Whitney, and
an article on “Indo-European Languages,” by Peter Giles.</p>

<p class='c007'>All languages may be roughly divided into two great
groups, <em>isolating</em> and <em>agglutinative</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The isolating languages are constructed on the principle
of single, distinct words for each idea, and do not employ
forms which add or drop syllables, or letters, in order to obtain
variety of expression, tense, mode, person, number, etc.
However, the element of intonation frequently plays a large
part in multiplying the number of possible forms, and therefore
of ideas, in isolating languages, by imparting to otherwise
identical words different meanings through pitch, rising
or falling inflection or accent.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the isolating languages belong most of those of southeastern
Asia,—Chinese, Burmese, Siamese, Thibetan, Annamite,
Cochin-Chinese, Malayan, etc. The term isolating
does not necessarily imply words of one syllable, although
there is a tendency in this direction since the roots are
stripped of all incumbrances of a modifying nature so common
in agglutinative or synthetic languages. The Chinese,
Burmese, Siamese and Annamite are classed as monosyllabic,
the Thibetan as half-monosyllabic, while the Malay is
polysyllabic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Because languages are isolating in structure does not mean
that they necessarily all belong to one family. They merely
have this structural principle in common. To establish
family relationships it is necessary to investigate the sets of
phonetics used, the root forms, the types of ideas expressed,
the composition of the sentence and various other important
points included under the psychology of habit and growth
forms of speech. No one of these alone is ordinarily sufficient
to prove that two languages are of one common stock,
since extensive borrowing of all kinds has occurred since time
immemorial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Nevertheless, in point of fact, taking languages as they
now exist, only those have been shown related which possess
a common structure, or have together grown out of the more
primitive radical stage, since structure proves itself a more
constant and reliable evidence than vocabulary. But, on
the other hand, since all structure is the result of growth,
and any degree of difference of structure, as well as of difference
of material, may be explained as the result of discordant
growth from identical beginnings, it is equally inadmissible
to claim that the diversities of languages prove them to have
had different beginnings.</p>

<p class='c007'>In isolating languages, word order is very important, but
here again the peculiar character of any tongue of this type
depends upon the order selected, or the relative importance
of ideas (general, specific, etc.). The employment of particles
makes possible a freer word order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>agglutinative</em> languages are those which combine roots
or parts of words or elements into new wholes to express
other related ideas than those imparted by the single forms,
or else entirely new concepts. Frequently these combinations
are still separable on occasion into their original elements,
or, if inseparable in their secondary meanings, their
original parts with their derivations are still recognizable as
such. Again, the component parts are no longer independent,
but form a firmly knit whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some languages certain classes of elements have arisen
which may be added in a perfectly formal manner to other
fixed roots or elements, with or without slight phonetic modifications
of either or both parts. Since this occurs in conformity
with fairly fixed rules, the meanings of the resultant
combinations are, according to the class of the attached elements
used, fairly analogous. Thus in English many verb
roots obtain the present participle by the addition of the
formal element <em>ing</em>, in itself now meaningless, but once, no
doubt, a separate root.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process of agglutination may be accomplished in many
different ways, any of which may be characteristic of whole
groups of unrelated languages. These may be roughly
divided first into mono- or oligo-synthetic and polysynthetic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>The former very nearly approach the isolating languages,
since usually only one element may be added at a time, but
the process of addition may be accomplished in any of the
ways possible to agglutination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Agglutination includes prefixing, suffixing and infixing
in all degrees of complexity and fixity. Thus languages may
be spoken of as agglutinative only in a relative sense. Some
are much more so than others, both in point of the number
of elements which it is possible to add, and their dependence
upon one another and the root, denoting a higher or lower
degree of inextricability in blending.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many languages are only loosely agglutinative and the
component parts of the compounds readily resolve. In
others, as in the inflecting languages, the combination is
inextricable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus under the head of agglutinative we have the merely
agglutinative or synthetic, readily resolvable combinations,
which are often hardly distinguishable from isolating languages,
and the less easily divisible inflectional and incorporating
types. Any or all of the three processes of infixing,
prefixing and suffixing may be employed in simple agglutinative
combinations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In inflectional languages the root is attended by prefixes
or suffixes which form inseparable modifiers. At times
phonetic changes occur which render the complex unlike the
simple joining of its component parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Mr. Sweet says: “If we define inflection as ‘agglutination
run mad’ we may regard incorporation as inflection
run madder still, for it is the result of attempting to develop
a verb into a complete sentence.” In some languages, such
as the incorporating, a verb is sufficiently distinct in its meaning
not to require an independent pronoun. French and
Spanish, though not belonging to this category, contain
words with the incorporating idea, as in Spanish <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hablo</span></i>, I
speak, and French, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pluit</span></i>, it rains. Where polysynthesism
is the prevailing character, the verb may be sufficiently comprehensive
to include the objective pronoun as well as the
subjective, so that it is possible to find in one word a transitive,
as well as in others an intransitive, sentence. But this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>is only rudimentary incorporation, and borders on inflection.
Some American Indian languages carry it to a very high
degree, appending to or inserting into this simple complex
not only nouns which may stand in apposition to the implied
or actual pronouns, but particles and modifiers of every description.
(See the <cite>Handbook of American Indian Languages</cite>,
published by the Bureau of American Ethnology at Washington.)
Frequently during this process various parts undergo
phonetic changes in accordance with fixed laws, so that
the final complex may not at all resemble a string of the
original elements, but becomes a new, inseparable and fixed
word containing a whole sentence of ideas. This sentence,
in some languages, may carry throughout certain modifiers
for all noun elements—for instance, as to whether the objects
under discussion are visible or invisible. These modifiers
bear definite relationships to the nouns, and the “sentence
word” in each of its parts must then be conjugated as a verb
in an even more complicated manner. This is agglutination
par excellence, and is frequently so complex as to be utterly
bewildering to the Indo-European mind, even though the
Indo-European languages themselves employ agglutination
to a limited degree and of certain varieties, particularly of
the inflectional order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Compared to the most complicated Indian tongues, English
is in the position of Chinese to Indo-European languages
in its structural simplicity, though of course in Chinese we
have an added complexity in the use of pitch, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certain types of speech which secure changes
(plurals, etc.) by internal vowel modification. English itself
makes use of this device, but it is the outstanding feature
of Semitic tongues.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sweet says: “There are many other minor criteria of morphological
classification. The most important of these is
perhaps that of the agglutinative or inflectional elements
before or after the word or stem [modified]. In Turkish
and in other Altaic languages, as also in Finnish, these are
always post-positions, so that every word begins with the
root which always has chief stress. The Bantu languages of
South Africa, on the other hand, favor prefixes.... The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>Semitic languages favor prefixes and post-positions about
equally. The Aryan languages are mainly post-positional,
with occasional use of prefixes, most of which, however, are
of later origin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It must not be supposed that languages fall into absolutely
distinct categories because of their structure. No
language to-day is purely of one type or another. There
have been too many centuries of borrowing and change for
that condition to now be possible for any language, nor
are there any longer what might be called primitive tongues.
They have all long since outgrown that state, whatever it
may have been, even the Botocudo of Brazil, which is generally
ranked as the most primitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Languages may now be classified only according to their
prevailing tendencies. Thus, modern English is in part
isolating, in part inflectional and in part agglutinative, as
that term is generally applied. Basque is an incorporating
language, far removed geographically and linguistically from
any other of that character. The Indo-European family
may be considered as inflectional, because that process is a
prominent feature, but it is by no means the only one present,
nor is it exclusively typical of that family.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt that all languages pass through certain
stages in their development, but it is not at all true that they
all have eventually the same or even similar histories. There
are endless possibilities of growth and decay, and this fact
alone excludes any set evolutionary scheme. Nor are the
isolating languages the most primitive. On the contrary,
they are as complex in their way as the most agglutinative
North American tongues, and as expressive, for some psychological
categories.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is little doubt that all languages have begun on an
isolating principle of simple roots for single ideas, from which
they have diverged in endless variety. Probably all inflectional
languages had an isolating and agglutinative stage,
although this is by no means proved. The Chinese seems to
have undergone an agglutinative past of some sort, but to
have resolved again into simple roots, with only traces of
fuller forms, but with the added complexity of tone, accent,
and order, to give, as Sweet puts it, “that extreme of elliptical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>conciseness and concentrated force of expression,
which excites our admiration.”</p>

<p class='c007'>English has become analytical, for many older inflected
words have now been worked over into combinations of independent
words, but this is far from a complete or consistent
process. Probably it will never become like the Chinese,
for to do away now with its inflectional system entirely
would necessitate a complete upheaval of structure which
is not likely to happen in the course of normal inner development,
particularly with a vast literature to assist in stabilizing
present forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards polysynthesism, or amount of agglutination, the
Aryan tongues are intermediate; they allow affixes, but only
within certain limits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Languages undoubtedly differ from one another in their
richness and power of expression, but may not be used as a
test of the intellectual capacity of those who now speak them.
In fact, men of any race can learn any language, unless abnormal.
To account for the great and striking difference of
structure among human languages is beyond the power of
the linguistic student, and will doubtless always continue so.
We are not likely to be able even to demonstrate a correlation
of capacities, saying that a race which has done this
and that in other departments might have been expected to
form such and such a language. Every tongue represents
the general outcome of the capacity of a race as exerted in
this particular direction, under the influence of historical
circumstances which we can have no hope of tracing, but
there are striking anomalies to be noted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Chinese and the Egyptians have shown themselves
to be among the most gifted races the earth has known;
but the Chinese tongue is of unsurpassed jejuneness, and the
Egyptian, in point of structure, little better, while among
the wild tribes of Africa and America we find tongues of
every grade up to a high one or the highest. This shows
clearly enough that mental power is not measured by language
structure. On the whole the value and rank of a
language are determined by what its users have made it
do—a poor tool in skilful hands can do vastly better work
than the best tool in unskilful hands, even as the ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Egyptians, without steel or steam, turned out products
which, both for colossal grandeur and for exquisite finish,
are the despair of modern engineers and artists.” In other
words, we must not underestimate the important part played
by habit or inertia. “The formation of habit is slow, and
once formed it exercises a constraining as well as a guiding
influence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indo-European language is one of the most highly
organized families of tongues that exist, and its greatest
power lies (in modern English, etc.) in its mixed structural
and material character. So to the Indo-European family
belongs incontestably the first place, and for many reasons,—the
historical position of the peoples speaking its dialects,
who have now long been the leaders in world history, the
abundance, variety and merit of its literatures ancient and
modern and, most of all, the great variety and richness of its
development. These have made it an illustration of the
history of human speech, which is extremely valuable and
the training ground of comparative philology.</p>

<p class='c007'>W. D. Whitney gives the following linguistic groups in
order of their importance from a literary standpoint:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd> 1. Indo-European (Indo-Germanic).  2. Semitic.  3. Hamitic.  4. Monosyllabic or 
    Southeastern Asiatic.  5. Ural-Altaic (Scythian, Turanian).  6. Dravidian or South 
    Indian.  7. Malay-Polynesian.  8. Oceanic—   <em>a.</em> Australian and Tasmanian.   
    <em>b.</em> Papuan and Negrito, etc.  9. Caucasian—   <em>a.</em> Circassian.   
    <em>b.</em> Mitsjeghian.   <em>c.</em> Lesghian, Georgian. 10. European Remnants—   
    Basque.   Etruscan?   Lydian? <span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>11. South African, Bantu. 12. Central African. 13. American.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>The first ten groups are families. So little is or was
known about the last three groups that the author of the
article classed together what are now known to be vast
agglomerations of families. For instance, the American
languages include several hundred distinct stocks, of which
fifty are found in California alone. These are all, according
to our present knowledge, utterly unrelated. It is known
that the central African tongues belong to a different group
than the southern, and it would be advisable to consult Sir
Harry Johnston’s recent large work on the Bantu languages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subdivision of the Indo-European family into cognate
languages is given here to show the great diversity of tongues
that may spring from one ancestor. Not all the dialects,
nor even languages, have been included, but only those best
known:</p>

<p class='c007'>242&#160;: 20–243&#160;: 4. Deniker, 2, p. 320, sums up Hirt’s position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>on this question in the footnote: “According to Hirt the
home of dispersion of the primitive Aryan language would
be found to the north of the Carpathians, in the Letto-Lithuanian
region. From this point two linguistic streams
would start flowing around the mountains to the west and
east; the western stream, after spreading over Germany
(Teutonic languages), left behind the Celtic languages in
the upper valley of the Danube, and filtered through on the
one side into Italy (Latin languages), on the other side into
Illyria, Albania, and Greece (Helleno-Illyrian languages).
The eastern stream formed the Slav languages in the plains
traversed by the Dnieper, then spread by way of the Caucasus
into Asia (Iranian languages and Sanscrit). In this
way we can account, on the one hand, for the less and less
marked relationship between the Aryan languages of the
present day and the common primitive dialect, and on the
other hand, for the diversity between the two groups of
Aryan languages, western and eastern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If this were so, Sanskrit should more closely resemble the
Slavic than the western languages. As it is, the old Vedic
speech, the earliest form of Sanskrit, is said to show more
affiliations with Greek than with any other of the Aryan
tongues (see Taylor, 1, p. 21, and authorities quoted), a
fact which merely adds another proof to our hypothesis that
sometime between 2000 and 1500 B. C. the Nordics filtered
down the Balkan peninsula in their earliest wave and about
the same time other branches found their way into northwestern
India. The Sanskrit alphabet is more closely related
to the Phœnician than to any other. At the time of
the first Nordic expansion their language was not reduced
to writing. The alphabet used for early Sanskrit, was, according
to Professor Bühler, probably introduced into India
by traders from Mesopotamia about 800 B. C. Another
authority on the relations of Greek and Sanskrit is Johannes
Schmidt, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der Indo-germanischen

<p class='c007'>243&#160;: 4. Prof. J. D. Prince, correspondence, in discussing
the kinship of prehistoric Ugrian to Aryan says that, although

<p class='c007'>254&#160;: 8. Ephtalites, or White Huns. Cahun, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de
l’Asie</span></cite>, pp. 43–55: “The Turks destroyed in the first half of
the seventh century a powerful nation, the Ephtalites of
Soghdiana, north of Persia. They were called Ephtalites,
or White Huns or Tie-le-urn Turks.” See also the notes to
pp. 119&#160;: 15 and 224&#160;: 3 of this book, and chap. XXVI in
Gibbon on the Huns in general.</p>

<p class='c007'>Procopius, vol. I, says in speaking of the Ephtalite Huns
and describing their war with the Persians about 450 A. D.:
“The White Huns are of the stock of the Huns in fact as
well as in name, living in the territory north of Persia, and
are settlers on the land in contrast to the Nomadic Huns
who live at a distance.... They are the only ones among
the Huns who have white bodies and countenances that are
not ugly and they are far more civilized than are the other
Huns.” The general impression gained from Procopius is
that they were not true Huns. “Massagetæ” is used as
another name for Huns by Procopius. He describes them
as mounted bowmen. It is clear that in using this name he
refers to Huns only.</p>

<p class='c007'>254&#160;: 13. Medes. The name Medes is variously applied
by different authorities; by many the Medes are regarded as
a branch of the  Persians, one of two kindred tribes of Nordics.
The author follows Zaborowski in applying the name
to the round skulled population which was conquered by
the Persians. See Zaborowski, 1, chaps. V and VI, especially
part II and p. 125. Also Herodotus in the references given
for Persia. Hall, <cite>Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, p. 459,
gives an interesting bit of their story.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>254&#160;: 15. Persians. The Persians were a branch of Nordics
who invaded the territory of the round skulled Medes,
and gradually imposed their language and much of their culture
on the subjugated populations. See Herodotus, book
I, especially 55, 71, 72, 74, 91, 95, 101, 107, 125, 129, 135, 136;
and book VI, 19, where he discusses both Medes and Persians.
For modern commentary the author follows Zaborowski,
1, pp. 138–139, 153 <em>seq.</em>, chap. VI, and also pp. 212–214.</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Luschan, pp. 233–234, describes the present day Persians,
showing that there has been a resurgence of types and
that the Nordic elements have been largely absorbed by the
original inhabitants. He adds, however, on p. 234, that
while he never saw Persians with light hair and blue eyes,
he was told that in some noble families fair types were not
very rare.</p>

156, on the Magi.</p>

<p class='c007'>254&#160;: 26. Darius. Zaborowski, 1, p. 12. Herodotus, I,
209, says: “Now Hystaspes the son of Arsames was of the
race of the Achæmenidæ and his eldest son Darius was at
that time twenty years old.” Another name for Hystaspes
was Vashtaspa, whose father was Arsames (Arsháma). He
traced his descent through four ancestors to Achæmenes
(Hakhámamish).</p>

<p class='c007'>Von Luschan, p. 241, says: “Nothing is known of the
Achæmenides who called themselves ‘Aryans of Aryan
stock’ and who brought the Aryan language to Persia.
About 1500 B. C. or earlier, there seems to have begun a
migration of northern men to Asia Minor, Syria, Persia,
Egypt and India. Indeed we can now connect even Further
India with the Mitanni of central Asia Minor.”</p>

Aryan stock. They are divided in the following table:</p>

<p class='c026'>Zaborowski, 1, p. 146, positively identifies Medic as agglutinative,
in which he agrees with Oppert. See chaps. V and
VI, especially part II and p. 125. For early data on the
Medes see the Herodotus references given under Persia.
Zaborowski says, p. 121, that Medic was spoken until 600
B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>255&#160;: 15. Kurdish. Von Luschan, p. 229: “The Kurds

western tribes, but both divisions are Aryan.” On the
Kurds as a people, see the notes to p. 225&#160;: 20.</p>

<p class='c007'>256&#160;: 3. Alexander the Great and the Persians. Plutarch,
<cite>Life of Alexander</cite>: “After this he accommodated himself
more than ever to the manners of the Asiatics, and at the
same time persuaded them to adopt some of the Macedonian
fashions, for by a mixture of both he thought a union might
be promoted much better than by force, and his authority
maintained when he was at a distance. For the same reason
he selected 30,000 boys and gave them masters to instruct
them in the Grecian literature as well as to train them to
arms in the Macedonian manner. As for his marriage with
Roxana, it was entirely the effect of love.... Nor was the
match unsuitable to the situation of his affairs. The barbarians
placed greater confidence in him on account of that
alliance.... Hephæstion and Craternus were his two
favorites. The former praised the Persian fashions and
dressed as he did; the latter adhered to the fashions of his
own country. He therefore employed Hephæstion in his
transactions with the barbarians and Craternus to signify
his pleasure to the Greeks and Macedonians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>256&#160;: 11 <em>seq.</em> Armenians. Ridgeway, 1, p. 396, speaking
of language, says: “That the Armenians were an offshoot of
the Phrygians as mentioned in Herodotus VII, 73, is proved
by the most modern linguistic results, which show that Armenian
comes closer to Greek than to the Iranian tongues.”
<em>Cf.</em> also Hall, <cite>Ancient History of the Near East</cite>, p. 475. This
need not imply racial affinity, however. The following notes
on Armenian were contributed by Mr. Leon Dominian:
“The proof of Aryan affinities in the Hittite language has
not yet been established. The great difficulty in establishing
the pre-Aryan relation of Armenian is due to the fact
that the earliest text dates only from the fifth century
A. D.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Cimmerians and Scythians, coming from southern
Europe by way of the Caucasus (Herodotus, IV, 11, 12),
reached Armenia about 720 B. C. (see Garstang, <cite>The Land of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the Hittites</cite>, p. 62). The old Vannic language antedating this
invasion resembles the Georgian of the Caucasus, according
to Sayce (<cite>Jour. Roy. As. Soc.</cite>, XIV, p. 410), who has studied
the local inscriptions. On p. 409 he infers that the Aryan
occupation of Armenia was coeval with the victory of Aryanism
in Persia at the end of the sixth century, B. C.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fact that Armenia is linguistically related to the
western groups of the Indo-European languages and that
the Persian element consists of loan words is corroborated by
geographical evidence. The Armenian highland culminating
in the 17000 foot altitude of Mt. Ararat has acted as a barrier
dividing the plateau of Anatolia from that of Iran.
Herodotus called the Armenians the ‘beyond’ Phrygians.”

possible to trace Sinhalese history and to prove that about
the middle of the sixth century B. C. a band of Aryan-speaking
people from India, under Vijaya conquered and settled
Ceylon permanently. There are a number of later
works on Ceylon, dealing with its archæology, flora, fauna,
history, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the British Indian Census of 1901 nearly
two-thirds of the inhabitants of Assam were Hindus, and the
language of Hinduism has become that of the province. The

<p class='c007'>258&#160;: 19. See Meillet, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Introduction á l’étude des langues
européens</span></cite>. On p. 37 he claims that the relation between the
two is comparable to that prevailing between High and Low
German. Zaborowski, 1, p. 184, says: “The language of the
Avesta, the Zend, is a contemporary dialect of the Persian
of Darius (<em>i. e.</em>, of Old Persian), from whence has come the
Pehlevi and its very close relative. It even presents the
closest affinities with the Sanskrit of the Vedas, from which
was derived, in the time of Alexander, classical Sanskrit.
This Sanskrit of the Vedas is itself so close to Old Persian
that it can be said that one and the other are only two pronunciations
of the same tongue.” See also the Indian Census
for 1901, vol. I, p. 294.</p>

<p class='c007'>259&#160;: 21. Sacæ or Saka. The Sacæ or Saka were the blond
peoples who carried the Aryan language to India. Strabo,
511, allies them with the Scythians as one of their tribes.
Many tribes were called Sacæ, especially by the Hindus, who
used the term indiscriminately to designate any northern
invaders of India.</p>

<p class='c007'>One tribe gained the most fertile tract in Armenia which
was called Sacasene, after them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Zaborowski, 1, p. 94, relates the Sacæ with the Scythians,
and says: “The Tadjiks are a people composed of suppressed
elements where blonds are found in an important minority.
These blonds, saving an atavistic survival of more ancient
or sporadic characters I can identify. They are the Sacæ.”
He continues, in a note, that a great error has been committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>on the subject of the Sacæ. “Repeating an assertion
of Alfred Maury, whose very sound erudition enjoyed a
merited reputation, I myself once repeated that the Sacæ
who figures on the rock of Behistun was of the Kirghiz type.
This assertion is completely erroneous. I have proved it
and can say that the Sacæ and the Scythians were identical.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Zaborowski, p. 216, also identifies the Sacæ with the Persians.
On this whole subject see Herodotus, VII, 64; also
Feist, 5.</p>

<p class='c007'>259&#160;: 21. Massagetæ. Zaborowski, 1, p. 285, says: “The
first information of history concerning the peoples of Turkestan
refers to the Massagetæ, whose life was exactly the
same as that of the Scythians (Herodotus, I, 205–216).
They enjoyed a developed industrial civilization while they
remained nomads. They were doubtless composed of ethnic
elements different from the Scythians, but probably already
spoke the Iranian tongue, like them. And since the time of
Darius, at least, there were in Turkestan with them and beside
them, Sacæ, whom the Greeks have always regarded as
Scythians come from Europe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Minns, <cite>Scythians and Greeks</cite>, p. 11, says: “The Scyths and
the Massagetæ were contemporaneous and different. The
Massagetæ are evidently a mixed collection of tribes without
an ethnic unity; the variety of their customs and states of
culture shows this and Herodotus does not seem to suggest
that they are all one people. They are generally reckoned
to be Iranian.... The picture drawn of the nomad Massagetæ
seems very like that of the Scythians in a rather ruder
stage of development.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Herodotus, I, 215, describes them as follows: “In their
dress and mode of living the Massagetæ resemble the Scythians.
They fight both on horseback and on foot, neither
method is strange to them.... The following are some of
their customs,—each man has but one wife, yet all wives are
held in common; for this is a custom of the Massagetæ and
not of the Scythians, as the Greeks wrongly say. Human
life does not come to its natural close with this people; but
when a man grows very old, all his kinsfolk collect together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>and offer him up in sacrifice; offering at the same time some
cattle also. After the sacrifice they boil the flesh and feast
on it; and those who thus end their days are reckoned the
happiest. If a man dies of disease they do not eat him, but
bury him in the ground, bewailing his ill fortune that he did
not come to be sacrificed. They sow no grain, but live on
their herds and on fish, of which there is great plenty in the
Araxes. Milk is what they chiefly drink. [<em>Cf.</em> the eastern
Siberian tribes of the present day.] The only god they worship
is the sun, and to him they offer the horse in sacrifice,
under the notion of giving to the swiftest of the gods, the
swiftest of all mortal creatures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>D’Arbois de Jubainville, 4, t. I, p. 231 declares they were
the same as the Scyths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Horse sacrifices are said to prevail among the modern
Parses. On the whole, the Massagetæ appear to have been
largely Nordic.</p>

<p class='c007'>259&#160;: 24. Kirghizes. See Zaborowski, 1, pp. 216, 290–291.</p>

Turkestan. (See the note to p. 119&#160;: 13.) On p. 471 he

Turkestan, basing himself on Chinese annals, the date being

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
